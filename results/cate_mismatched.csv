For surveys which did not strictly adhere to the global Enterprise Surveys methodology, plus Afghanistan, any inference from one of these surveys is representative only for the data sample itself, not the country level.","SIPRI statistical data on arms transfers relates to actual deliveries of major conventional weapons. To permit comparison between the data on such deliveries of different weapons and to identify general trends, SIPRI has developed a unique system to measure the volume of international transfers of major conventional weapons using a common unit, the trend-indicator value (TIV). The TIV is based on the known unit production costs of a core set of weapons and is intended to represent the transfer of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer. Weapons for which a production cost is not known are compared with core weapons based on: size and performance characteristics (weight, speed, range and payload); type of electronics, loading or unloading arrangements, engine, tracks or wheels, armament and materials; and the year in which the weapon was produced. A weapon that has been in service in another armed force is given a value 40 per cent of that of a new weapon. A used weapon that has been significantly refurbished or modified by the supplier before delivery is given a value of 66 per cent of that of a new weapon.","Depending on the source and means of monitoring, data may not be exactly comparable across countries. See listed source for country-specific details."

The expected investment return each year is calculated based on the actuarial value of assets with the difference from actual income smoothed in over five years in 20% increments.
