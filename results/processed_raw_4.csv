FAO collects fertilizer statistics for production, imports, exports, and consumption through the new FAO fertilizer resources questionnaire. In the previous release, the data were based on total consumption of fertilizers, but the data in the recent release are based on the nutrients in fertilizers. Some countries compile fertilizer data on a calendar year basis, while others compile on a crop year basis (July-June). Previous editions of this indicator, Fertilizer consumption (100 grams per hectare of arable land), reported data on a crop year basis, but this edition uses the calendar year, as adopted by the FAO.

Agricultural land indicator, along with land-use indicators, can also elucidate the environmental sustainability of countries' agricultural practices.True comparability of the data is limited, however, by variations in definitions, statistical methods, and quality of data. Countries use different definitions land use. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the primary compiler of the data, occasionally adjusts its definitions of land use categories and revises earlier data. Because the data reflect changes in reporting procedures as well as actual changes in land use, apparent trends should be interpreted cautiously.Satellite images show land use that differs from that of ground-based measures in area under cultivation and type of land use. Moreover, land use data in some countries (India is an example) are based on reporting systems designed for collecting tax revenue.

To permit comparison between the data on such deliveries of different weapons and to identify general trends, SIPRI has developed a unique system to measure the volume of international transfers of major conventional weapons using a common unit, the trend-indicator value (TIV). The TIV is based on the known unit production costs of a core set of weapons and is intended to represent the transfer of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer. Weapons for which a production cost is not known are compared with core weapons based on: size and performance characteristics (weight, speed, range and payload); type of electronics, loading or unloading arrangements, engine, tracks or wheels, armament and materials; and the year in which the weapon was produced. A weapon that has been in service in another armed force is given a value 40 per cent of that of a new weapon. A used weapon that has been significantly refurbished or modified by the supplier before delivery is given a value of 66 per cent of that of a new weapon.","Depending on the source and means of monitoring, data may not be exactly comparable across countries.

Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on the tractor, and the tractor may also provide a source of power if the implement is mechanized. The most common use of the term ""tractor"" is for the vehicles used on farms. The farm tractor is used for pulling or pushing agricultural machinery or trailers, for plowing, tilling, disking, harrowing, planting, and similar tasks. Planting, tending and harvesting a crop requires both a significant amount of power and a suitable range of tools and equipment. Mechanization of farming has allowed an increase to the area that can be planted and has contributed towards increased yields, mainly due to the precision with which the farming tasks can be accomplished.","Fertilizer consumption measures the quantity of plant nutrients, and is calculated as production plus imports minus exports. Because some chemical compounds used for fertilizers have other industrial applications, the consumption data may overstate the quantity available for crops. Fertilizer consumption as a share of production shows the agriculture sector's vulnerability to import and energy price fluctuation.Most fertilizers that are commonly used in agriculture contain the three basic plant nutrients - nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Some fertilizers also contain certain ""micronutrients,"" such as zinc and other metals that are necessary for plant growth. Materials that are applied to the land primarily to enhance soil characteristics (rather than as plant food) are commonly referred to as soil amendments. Fertilizers and soil amendments are largely derived from raw material, composts and other organic matter, and wastes, such as sewage sludge and certain industrial wastes.FAO defines arable land as land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow; land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded.","Agricultural land constitutes only a part of any country's total area, which can include areas not suitable for agriculture, such as forests, mountains, and inland water bodies. Three components of the agricultural land are a) arable land - land defined by the FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow, b) permanent pasture - land used for five or more years for forage, including natural and cultivated crops, and c) and under permanent crops - land cultivated with crops that occupy the land for long periods and need not be replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa, coffee, and rubber; land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines is included, but land under trees grown for wood or timber is not.Agricultural land is also sometimes classified as irrigated and non-irrigated land. In arid and semi-arid countries agriculture is often confined to irrigated land, with very little farming possible in non-irrigated areas. Land abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded from arable land.Data on agricultural land are valuable for conducting studies on a various perspectives concerning agricultural production, food security and for deriving cropping intensity among others uses. Agricultural land indicator, along with land-use indicators, can also elucidate the environmental sustainability of countries' agricultural practices.","Agriculture is still a major sector in many economies, and agricultural activities provide developing countries with food and revenue. But agricultural activities also can degrade natural resources. Poor farming practices can cause soil erosion and loss of soil fertility. Efforts to increase productivity by using chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and intensive irrigation have environmental costs and health impacts.

In many industrialized countries, agricultural land is subject to zoning regulations. In the context of zoning, agricultural land (or more properly agriculturally zoned land) refers to plots that may be used for agricultural activities, regardless of the physical type or quality of land.A substantial contribution to agriculture in the last century has been the escalation from manual and stock-animal farm work to gas-powered farm equipment. Globally, steel plows, mowers, mechanical reapers, seed drills, and threshers contributed to the development of mechanized agriculture, tractors enabled the farmer to sow and harvest large agricultural lands with less manpower. In modern times, powered machinery such as tractors, has replaced many jobs formerly carried out by men or animals such as oxen, horses and mules. FAO estimates that most farmers in developing countries experience a greater annual expenditure on farm power inputs than on fertilizer, seeds or agrochemicals.Agriculture is still a major sector in many economies, and agricultural activities provide developing countries with food and revenue. But agricultural activities also can degrade natural resources as poor farming practices cause soil erosion and loss of soil fertility.There is no single correct mix of inputs to the agricultural land, as it is dependent on local climate, land quality, and economic development; appropriate levels and application rates vary by country and over time and depend on the type of crops, the climate and soils, and the production process used.","Factors such as the green revolution, has led to impressive progress in increasing crop yields over the last few decades. This progress, however, is not equal across all regions. Continued progress depends on maintaining agricultural research and education. The cultivation of cereals varies widely in different countries and depends partly upon the development of the economy. Production depends on the nature of the soil, the amount of rainfall, irrigation, quality od seeds, and the techniques applied to promote growth.Agriculture is still a major sector in many economies, and agricultural activities provide developing countries with food and revenue. But agricultural activities also can degrade natural resources. Poor farming practices can cause soil erosion and loss of soil fertility. Efforts to increase productivity by using chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and intensive irrigation have environmental costs and health impacts. Salinization of irrigated land diminishes soil fertility. Thus, inappropriate use of inputs for agricultural production has far-reaching effects.In many developed countries, excessive nitrogen fertilizer applications have sometime lead to pest problems by increasing the birth rate, longevity and overall fitness of certain agricultural pests, such as aphids. Further, excessive use of fertilizers emits significant quantities of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Over-fertilization of a vital nutrient can be detrimental, as ""fertilizer burn"" can occur when too much fertilizer is applied, resulting in drying out of the leaves and damage or even death of the plant. In many industrialized countries, overuse of fertilizers has resulted in contamination of surface water and groundwater.There is no single correct mix of inputs to the agricultural land, as it is dependent on local climate, land quality, and economic development; appropriate levels and application rates vary by country and over time and depend on the type of crops, the climate and soils, and the production process used.","Agricultural land covers more than one-third of the world's land area.

Thus, inappropriate use of inputs for agricultural production has far-reaching effects.There is significant geographic variation in the availability of land considered suitable for agriculture. Increasing population and demand from other sectors place growing pressure on available resources. According to FAO, the world's cultivated area has grown by 12 percent over the last 50 years. The global irrigated area has doubled over the same period, accounting for most of the net increase in cultivated land. Agriculture already uses 11 percent of the world's land surface for crop production. It also makes use of 70 percent of all water withdrawn from aquifers, streams and lakes. Agricultural policies have primarily benefitted farmers with productive land and access to water, bypassing the majority of small-scale producers who are still locked in a poverty trap of high vulnerability, land degradation and climatic uncertainty.Land resources are central to agriculture and rural development, and are intrinsically linked to global challenges of food insecurity and poverty, climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as degradation and depletion of natural resources that affect the livelihoods of millions of rural people across the world.In many industrialized countries, agricultural land is subject to zoning regulations.

The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system. But the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate America. IBM said last year that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things. Microsoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure. ""Ethereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution - the most elegant solution we have seen to date,"" said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft. Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft's work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository. Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together - somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users. Many corporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system - known as an Ether - that people have recently been buying. The interest in Ethereum is one sign of the corporate fascination with blockchains. Most major banks have expressed an interest in using them to make trading and money transfer faster and more efficient. On Tuesday, executives from the largest banks will gather for a conference, ""Blockchain: Tapping I nto the Real Potential , Cutting Through the Hype."" Many of these banks have recently been looking at how some version of Ethereum might be put to use. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a specific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum blockchain. Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress's investment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress last fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a ""significant"" purchase of Ether in January. He has also heard how the financial industry's chatter about the virtual currency has evolved. ""A lot of the more established players were thinking, 'It's still an experiment,' "" he said. ""It feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation."" Since the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week. Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario. The most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain - the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source - say, The Associated Press - the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet. The Ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether. A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin's team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software's development. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers - or nodes - helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes. One of Mr. Buterin's co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up ConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing. The ConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around. Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of Bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets. ""Bitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver that vision,"" he said. Joseph Bonneau, a computer science researcher at Stanford who studies so-called crypto-currencies, said Ethereum was the first system that had really caught his interest since Bitcoin. It is far from a sure thing, he cautioned. ""Bitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,"" Mr. Bonneau said. ""It will depend if any real markets develop around it. If there is some actual application.""","The alarm clock wakes me at 8:00 with stream of advert-free broadcasting, charged at one satoshi per second.

Several months ago, those of us on the Google Cloud Developer Advocacy Team had a rare opportunity to tour the Google data center in The Dalles, Oregon. Many of us had seen other non-Google data centers in our careers, but this experience was beyond anything we ever imagined. We were blown away by the scale, the incredible attention to security and privacy, and the amazing efforts to make the data center extremely efficient and green. Additionally, we were proud to meet some of the brilliant people that design, build and maintain these data centers. If you are a Google Cloud Platform customer, then this is your data center as much as it is our data center, so we want you to experience what we experienced. We hope you enjoy it! - Posted by Greg Wilson, Head of Developer Advocacy, Google Cloud Platform","The Aite Group projects the blockchain market could be valued at $400 million by 2019. For that reason, some of the biggest names in banking, industry and technology have entered into the space to evaluate how this technology could change the financial world. IBM and Linux, for instance, have brought together some of the brightest minds in the industry and technology to work on blockchain technology through the Hyperledger Project. The Hyperledger Project is under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, and seeks to incorporate findings by blockchain projects such as Blockstream, Ripple, Digital Asset Holdings and others in order to make blockchain technology useful for the world's biggest corporations. IBM has also contributed its own code to the project. According to John Wolpert, IBM's Global Blockchain Offering Director, when IBM and Linux began working together on the blockchain project, Linux made clear it wanted to ""disrupt the disruption,"" in part with their findings, as well as the data gathered by projects such as Ripple, Ethereum and others exploring the blockchain. The Linux foundation announced its Hyperledger project on December 17, 2015. Just one day later, 2,300 companies had requested to join. The second-largest open source foundation in the history of open source had only 450 inquiries. ""So, it's either going to be a holy mess or it's going to change the world,"" Wolpert said at The Blockchain Conference in San Francisco presented by Lighthouse Partners. As Wolford puts it, a team of IBMers is ""on a quest"" to understand and ""do something important"" with blockchain technology. ""I don't know why we got this rap in the '70s, way back, that we are not cool, that we're kind of stodgy, and that is not the IBM of my experience,"" Wolpert, who founded the taxi service Flywheel, explained. ""We're the original crazy people. The craziest people are the guys at IBM in the '60s and '70s -- you can imagine what they were doing in the '60s -- they are wild-eyed revolutionaries."" Although this is not the image IBM markets, their work in quantum computing, quantum teleportation and neuro semantic chips count among some of the ""cool stuff"" IBM does, says Wolpert. IBM also approaches projects in the spirit of open innovation, and not proprietarily. ""Our method of operations is open, and it's often our MO to back not-our-thing,"" he said of IBM since the 1990s. Wolpert cites Java as one such project: ""You would not know about Java today if it weren't for IBM."" As a ""pretty young dude,"" Wolpert was in the room when IBM made a billion-dollar decision to back Linux over its own technology. He also cites IBM's work on XML as an example of IBM's dedication to open innovation. Currently, IBM has employees working on crypto-security and distributed systems who have been working on consensus algorithms for their entire careers, some for more than 30 years. ""They're crazy smart, we're planetary, we've gone from a couple of guys in a canoe, to a platoon and approaching an army of people working on blockchain,"" Wolpert said. ""So it feels a lot like my first job at IBM which was making Java real for business."" This has led old and new friends to contact the the multinational technology and consulting corporation. ""Banks who have been calling us constantly ... saying 'What's your view on blockchain?' or 'Hey, let's do a project together on blockchain,'"" Wolpert said. ""We've been doing all these crazy projects on blockchain, every kind of blockchain, and learning a lot, been doing that for a couple years and really started to accelerate last year."" Today, there is a whole unit dedicated to blockchain technology at Linux Foundation. ""We went all-in on blockchain,"" he explained. What's it all about for Wolpert? ""It's about evolving the Internet."" Bitcoin is important for moving money around without a single authority. ""[Bitcoin] is a solution to a problem, a specific problem, of people who need to move money around in environments where you don't trust the government,"" Wolpert said. ""I think we can all agree we are approaching the end of the era where a single authority manages trust and gets compensated for the risk in doing so."" In Wolpert's view, finance does not need to go from today's system of trust -- where consumers trust institutions to handle their money -- to one of complete trustlessness, like the Bitcoin system in which a protocol, not a centralized authority, manages the movement of value. ""It doesn't follow, having one single trust authority to trustlessness on everything,"" he said. ""There is a false dichotomy between the notion of trust and trustlessness, that you have to have a walled garden on one side and Bitcoin on the other."" He doesn't compare Bitcoin to the Internet, saying that's a wrong analogy. ""It is not apt to say the Internet is like Bitcoin; the Internet is, from the perspective of Bitcoin, a permissioned walled garden,"" he said. ""Ever heard of ICANN? It's permissive, but it's permissioned."" Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum are ""Iteration 1"" of blockchain technology, the three time IBMer told his audience. Wolpert thinks blockchain technology will soon evolve to ""Iteration 2."" The problem with it? ""The Internet is constrained,"" Wolpert said. ""You have a fabric that allows for lots of competition on platforms and huge amounts of competition on solutions and applications on top of it, so we need to evolve the Internet to become economically aware, and that Internet isn't going to be an application, it is going to be a fabric and then lots of applications on top of that."" This doesn't mean blockchain 2.0 technologies such as Blockstream, Ethereum and Ripple are lost causes that must now completely retool. The Linux Foundation, in fact, works with Ethereum and Ripple employees. With its blockchain projects, IBM is not focused on moving a cryptocurrency. ""Lots of banks pay us lots of money and we like that, and we want to radically improve them,"" Wolpert explained. ""[Bankers] are gonna try like heck to radically improve what is going on ahead of the disruption, disrupt themselves if you will. If you look at things like [Overstock's] t0, that's happening, might happen on Bitcoin protocol, but might not, and there's plenty of ways to solve it, when you commit to it. And sure, Bitcoin has woken [banks] up to this, so it's doing its job, it's disrupting the thinking and maybe that is all that is necessary."" Wolpert wonders aloud during his speech if the world would have iTunes were it not for Napster, or Netflix if it weren't for BitTorrent. The former head of products for IBM's Watson Ecosystem says IBM currently has a ""boomtown with giant numbers of people at IBM and everywhere else"" investigating the blockchain problem and how distributed technology can be made useful for industry. He details how oftentimes IBM tinkers with open innovations itself to make the technology ready for industry. That's not the route being taken with Bitcoin. That the Bitcoin network is on par with Ireland for energy consumption, and that mining consortiums could eventually dictate that market, scares the firm away from dealing directly with Bitcoin. ""What I want to see, what we want to see, is a world full of companies who I can know, who I can identify, who are so spread out, like the Internet,"" he said. Wolpert cites the Arab Spring, and the role the Internet played in that uprising, as how a permissioned, yet permissive, structure functions. Websites, albeit technology permissioned by ICANN, remained online during the protests and played a major role. What's the risk in experimenting with blockchain? ""The risk is we go crazy, we have an unruly mess,"" Wolpert warned. ""[But] it's the Linux Foundation, we've been in this movie before. While there's a lot of really smart guys working on Bitcoin and startups, we've got equally amount of people who also have 20 or 30 years of experience with open source and open innovation, and I think we have a good shot at maintaining restraints, keeping it scoped down, keeping it simple, but getting it to something that is useful.""","One of the largest and oldest organizations for computing professionals will kick off its annual conference on the future of mobile cloud computing tomorrow, where blockchain is scheduled to be one of the attractions. With more than 421,000 members in 260 countries, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) holding such a high-profile event has the potential to accelerate the rate of blockchain adoption by the engineering community. At the four-day conference, beginning Tuesday, the IEEE will host five blockchain seminars at the 702-year-old Exeter College of Oxford. The conference, IEEE Mobile Cloud 2016, is the organization's fourth annual event dedicated to mobile cloud computing services and engineering. Speaking at the event, hosted at Oxford University, professor Wei-Tek Tsai of the School of Computing, Informatics and Decision Systems engineering at Arizona State University will talk about the future of blockchain technology as an academic topic of research. Computing shift While this looks to be the first IEEE conference to deal so closely with blockchain, its presence at an event dedicated to cloud computing is no surprise. 2016 is shaping up to be the year many stopped talking about bitcoin as a decentralized ledger and started talking about it as a database. Last month, IBM made a huge splash in the blockchain ecosystem when it announced among a wide range of other news, that it would be offering a wide range of blockchain-related initiatives. Further, in November, Microsoft coined the term Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) to describe its sandbox environment where developers could experiment with tools hosted on the company's Azure Cloud platform. Companies including ConsenSys, Augur, BitShares and Slock.it have joined that effort.

The expected investment return each year is calculated based on the actuarial value of assets with the difference from actual income smoothed in over five years in 20% increments. If the current years difference is opposite sign of any of the prior years deferred Excesses/(Shortfalls), then the prior years bases (starting with the oldest) are reduced dollar for dollar along with the current years base. Any remaining bases are then recognized over five years (20% per year) from their initial creation. If the resulting preliminary asset value is less than 80% or more than 120% of the market value of assets, then 1/3 of the amount outside of the 80%-120% corridor is recognized in the final actuarial value of assets.","If expected actuarial assets are greater than market assets then actuarial assets can be no lower than market assets.

4982,927,2,c,Negative_Review,515738,330011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer,No Negative,Rooms are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps So ask for single level Inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge,My room was dirty and I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in bed and ready to sleep,You When I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room I thought I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly Which was completely false advertising After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday present Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again I didn t really know what I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being Your photos told me I was getting something I wasn t Not happy and won t be using you again,0.02910382731031562,0.02910382731031562,0.9126885180690532,0.02910382731031562,0.6398811024202211,0.0,0,0,156.6

The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit, which challenges the administrationÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for   and   Americans, handing House Republicans a big victory on    issues. But a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode, leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before Republicans have prepared a replacement. That could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as Republicans gain full control of the government. To stave off that outcome, Republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the Obama health care law, angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years. In another twist, Donald J. TrumpÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s administration, worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives, could choose to fight its Republican allies in the House on some central questions in the dispute. Eager to avoid an ugly political pileup, Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit, which, after the election, has been put in limbo until at least late February by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They are not yet ready to divulge their strategy. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍGiven that this pending litigation involves the Obama administration and Congress, it would be inappropriate to comment,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ said Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition effort. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍUpon taking office, the Trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ In a potentially   decision in 2015, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that House Republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the Obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies, in violation of the Constitution, without approval from Congress. The Justice Department, confident that Judge CollyerÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s decision would be reversed, quickly appealed, and the subsidies have remained in place during the appeal. In successfully seeking a temporary halt in the proceedings after Mr. Trump won, House Republicans last month told the court that they Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍand the  Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s transition team currently are discussing potential options for resolution of this matter, to take effect after the  Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ The suspension of the case, House lawyers said, will Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍprovide the   and his future administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or to otherwise resolve this appeal. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Republican leadership officials in the House acknowledge the possibility of Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍcascading effectsÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ if the   payments, which have totaled an estimated $13 billion, are suddenly stopped. Insurers that receive the subsidies in exchange for paying    costs such as deductibles and   for eligible consumers could race to drop coverage since they would be losing money. Over all, the loss of the subsidies could destabilize the entire program and cause a lack of confidence that leads other insurers to seek a quick exit as well. Anticipating that the Trump administration might not be inclined to mount a vigorous fight against the House Republicans given the  Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s dim view of the health care law, a team of lawyers this month sought to intervene in the case on behalf of two participants in the health care program. In their request, the lawyers predicted that a deal between House Republicans and the new administration to dismiss or settle the case Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍwill produce devastating consequences for the individuals who receive these reductions, as well as for the nationÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s health insurance and health care systems generally. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ No matter what happens, House Republicans say, they want to prevail on two overarching concepts: the congressional power of the purse, and the right of Congress to sue the executive branch if it violates the Constitution regarding that spending power. House Republicans contend that Congress never appropriated the money for the subsidies, as required by the Constitution. In the suit, which was initially championed by John A. Boehner, the House speaker at the time, and later in House committee reports, Republicans asserted that the administration, desperate for the funding, had required the Treasury Department to provide it despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending was proper. The White House said that the spending was a permanent part of the law passed in 2010, and that no annual appropriation was required  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   even though the administration initially sought one. Just as important to House Republicans, Judge Collyer found that Congress had the standing to sue the White House on this issue  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   a ruling that many legal experts said was flawed  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   and they want that precedent to be set to restore congressional leverage over the executive branch. But on spending power and standing, the Trump administration may come under pressure from advocates of presidential authority to fight the House no matter their shared views on health care, since those precedents could have broad repercussions. It is a complicated set of dynamics illustrating how a quick legal victory for the House in the Trump era might come with costs that Republicans never anticipated when they took on the Obama White House.","After the bullet shells get counted, the blood dries and the votive candles burn out, people peer down from   windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze. The South Bronx, just across the Harlem River from Manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction, still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of New York City. And yet the cityÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s efforts to fight it remain splintered, underfunded and burdened by scandal. In the 40th Precinct, at the southern tip of the Bronx, as in other poor, minority neighborhoods across the country, people long hounded for   infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death. By September, four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved. Out of the cityÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s 77 precincts, the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime, reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan, according to a New York Times analysis of Police Department data. Investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends, even as their bosses are called to Police Headquarters to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year. And across the Bronx, investigative resources are squeezed. It has the highest   rate of the cityÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing. Nine of the 14   precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there. The boroughÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s robbery squad is smaller than ManhattanÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s, even though the Bronx has had 1, 300 more cases this year. And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders, compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper Manhattan and more than one detective per murder in Lower Manhattan. In   lobbies and   family apartments, outside methadone clinics and art studios, people take note of the inequity. They hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a   corner. They watch witnesses cower behind   doors, more fearful of a gunmanÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s crew than confident in the Police DepartmentÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s ability to protect them. So though people see a lot, they rarely testify. And in the South Bronx, as in so many predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods like it in the United States, the contract between the police and the community is in tatters. Some people have stories of crime reports that were ignored, or 911 calls that went unanswered for hours. Others tell of a 911 call for help ending in the callerÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s arrest, or of a minor charge leading to 12 hours in a fetid holding cell. This is the paradox of policing in the 40th Precinct. Its neighborhoods have historically been prime targets for aggressive tactics, like    that are designed to ward off disorder. But precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes. Gola White, who was beside her daughter when she was shot and killed in a playground this summer, four years after her son was gunned down in the same housing project, ticked off the public safety resources that she said were scant in Bronx neighborhoods like hers: security cameras, lights, locks, investigating police officers. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍHere, we have nothing,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ she said. When it comes to Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ  families,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ she said, the authorities Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍdonÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t really care as much. ThatÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s how I feel. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ The Times has been documenting the murders logged this year in the 40th Precinct, one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence remains a problem in an era of   crime in New York City. The homicides  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   14 in the precinct this year, up from nine in 2015  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   strain detectives, and when they go unsolved, as half of them have this year, some look to take the law into their own hands. From hundreds of conversations with grieving relatives and friends, witnesses and police officers, the social forces that flare into murder in a place like the 40th Precinct become clearer: merciless gang codes, mental illness, drugs and long memories of feuds that simmered out of officersÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ view. The reasons some murders will never be solved also emerge: paralyzing fear of retribution, victims carrying secrets to their graves and relentless casework that forces detectives to move on in hopes that a break will come later. Frustrations build on all sides. DetectivesÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ phones rarely ring with tips, and officers grow embittered with witnesses who will not cooperate. In the meantime, a victimÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s friends conduct their own investigations, and talk of grabbing a stash gun from a wheel well or a motherÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s apartment when they find their suspect. In the chasm between the police and the community, gangs and gun violence flourish. Parents try to protect their families from drug crewsÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ threats, and officers work to overcome the residue of years of mistrust and understaffing in communities where they still go racing from one 911 call to the next. The streets around St. MaryÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s Park were the scene of two fatal shootings logged in the 40th Precinct this year. Both are unsolved. James Fernandez heard talk of the murders through the door of his   apartment on East 146th Street in a     the Betances Houses. He lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles, empty dope bags and discarded Hennessy bottles. A   young men who spoke of being in a subset of the Bloods gang had made it their drug market, slinging marijuana and cocaine to regulars, flashing firearms and blowing smoke into the Fernandez apartment. When Mr. Fernandez, 40, asked the young men to move, they answered by busting up his car. This kind of crime, an anachronism in much of New York, still rattles the 40th Precinct, even though murders there have fallen to 14 this year from 83 in 1991. It has more major felony crimes per resident than any other residential district in the city. It is also one of the poorest communities in the country, and many young men find their way into underground markets. Mr. Fernandez was not one to shrink from the threats. When he was growing up on the Lower East Side, he rode his bicycle around to the customers of the drug dealers he worked for and collected payments in a backpack. After leaving that life, he got a tech maintenance job and, three years ago, moved into the Betances Houses with his wife and daughter, now 11. He had two choices to get help with the drug crew: call the police for help and risk being labeled a snitch, or call his old Lower East Side bosses for muscle and risk violence. He chose the police. Again and again, he walked into a local substation, Police Service Area 7, and asked for protection. His daughter was using an inhaler to relieve coughs from the marijuana smoke. Mr. Fernandez and his wife got terrible headaches. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThereÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s a lot of killers here, and we are going to kill you,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ a sergeantÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s police report quoted a    telling Mr. Fernandez in August 2015. A second report filed the same day said a    warned him, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍIÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_m going to shoot through your window. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Mr. Fernandez told the police both the teenagersÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ names, which appear in the reports, and then went home. He said one of their friends had seen him walk into the substation, and they tried to intimidate him out of filing another report. Three days later, the same    propped his bike on their door, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍthen said if I was to open the door and say something, they would body slam me,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Mr. FernandezÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s wife, Maria Fernandez, wrote on slips of paper she used to document the hallway ruckus and the inadequate police response. The boys made comments about how easy a target she was and about how they would have to Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍslapÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ her if she opened the door while they made a drug sale, and they threatened to beat the Fernandez family because Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍthey are the ones snitching,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ her notes say. But another   complaint at the substation, 10 days after the first, brought no relief. A week later, feeling desperate, Ms. Fernandez tried calling: first to the substation, at 8:50 p. m. when one of the boys blew weed smoke at her door and made a   threat to attack her, and then to 911 at 10:36 p. m. The police never came, she wrote in her notes. She tried the 40th Precinct station house next, but officers at the desk left her standing in the public waiting area for a   she said, making her fear being seen again. Officers put her in worse danger some months later, she said, when they came to her door and announced in front of the teenagers that they were there on a complaint about drug activity. Mr. Fernandez started doing the work that he said the police had failed to do. He wired a camera into his peephole to record the drugs and guns. The footage hark back to the New York of the 1980s, still very much present to some of the precinctÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s residents. Around 6:30 each morning, Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th Precinct station house. The cases that land on his metal desk  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   dead bodies with no known cause, strip club brawls, shooting victims hobbling into the hospital themselves  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   bring resistance at every turn, reminding him of an earlier era in the cityÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s   campaign. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI havenÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t got one single phone call thatÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s putting me in the right direction here,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ said Sergeant LoPuzzo, the head of the precinctÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s detective squad, one day this summer as he worked on an answer to an email inquiry from a murder victimÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s aunt about why the killer had not been caught. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍAnd people just donÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t understand that. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police. Witnesses shout them away from their doors just so neighbors know they refuse to talk. Of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the Bronx through early September, more than a third  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   66 victims  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   refused to cooperate. Over the same period in the 40th Precinct, squad detectives closed three of 17 nonfatal shootings, and 72 of 343 robbery cases. Part of the resistance stems from   preventive policing tactics, like    that were a hallmark of the     style under former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly. Near the height of the    strategy, in 2012, the 40th Precinct had the   stops in the city, the   stops in which officers used force and the most frisks. Of 18, 276 stops that year, 15, 521 were of people who had done nothing criminal. The precinct was also one of the   areas that the department flooded with its newest officers. At roll calls, they were pressured to generate numbers: write tickets and make arrests. They had no choice but to give a summons to a young man playing in a park after dark, even if the officers had done the same growing up in the same neighborhood. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI need to bring something in today to justify my existence,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Officer Argenis Rosado, who joined the precinct in 2010, said in an interview at the station house. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍSo now youÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_re in a small area, and day after day youÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_re hammering the same community. Of course that communityÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s eventually going to turn on you. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ The pressure warped the way officers and residents saw each other. Rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍSome of the cops that came out at that time probably viewed the community differently, too,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ said Hector Espada, a   veteran of the precinct. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍNot because they wanted to, but because they had to. Because some way or somehow, you canÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t give someone a $115 summons and feel like you guys could still have a civil conversation after that. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Morale wilted in the aged station house on Alexander Avenue, in Mott Haven. Officers felt pressure to downgrade crime complaints to make them appear less serious. Several said in interviews that they had overlooked crime reports from immigrants because they were seen as unlikely to complain, and watched supervisors badger victims into repeating their stories in hopes that they would drop their complaints. The practice of downgrading complaints resulted in the disciplining of 19 officers in the precinct last year, one in a string of scandals that has left officers there feeling overscrutinized for problems that also existed elsewhere. Four commanders in the precinct were sent packing in five years, one of them after officers were found to be Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍticket fixing,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ or forgiving parking tickets for friends, and another after he was recorded giving guidance on whom to stop and frisk: black boys and men, ages 14 to 21. Some officers fled to other commands. Others became reluctant to take assignments in proactive policing units, like   that put them in   situations on the street. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍWhenever I walked through the doors of the precinct, to me, it seemed like a black cloud,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ said Russell Lewis, a    of the 40th. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍIt was like a heaviness. When you walked in, all you wanted to do was do your 8 hours 35 minutes and go home, because you didnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t want to get caught up in anything. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ The precinct covers only about two square miles, but the more than a dozen housing projects there mean that it overflows with people. Methadone clinics draw addicts from around the city.   lofts on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification. Even as the Police Department has hired 1, 300 more officers for neighborhood policing and counterterrorism, officers in the 40th Precinct said they could still rush to 25 911 calls during a shift  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   a number unchanged from what the new police commissioner, James P. OÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_Neill, said he was handling in a similar South Bronx precinct 15 years ago. Several dozen calls at a time can be waiting for a response. Residents know that if you want the police for a domestic problem, it helps to hint that there is a weapon. Last year, the precinct drew the   number of civilian complaints for officer misconduct in the city, and the most lawsuits stemming from police actions. The precinct is trying to improve morale under a new commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Brian Hennessy. A cadre of what the department calls neighborhood coordination officers has been on patrol since last January, part of a citywide effort under Mr. OÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio to bring back the beat cop, unencumbered by chasing every last 911 call, who can listen to peopleÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s concerns and help with investigations. The precinct has made among the most gun arrests in the city, and officers said they now had more discretion to resolve encounters without a summons or an arrest. At one corner near a school, on Courtlandt Avenue and East 151st Street, that has long spawned complaints about gunfire and fights, Inspector Hennessy and some of his officers painted over graffiti and swept up drug paraphernalia this summer. People said it was the first answer to their complaints in years. But the inspector acknowledged that the residue of   policing lingers. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThat perception really sticks,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he said. The workload in the 40th Precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in Manhattan compared with the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. Three of the precinctÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s 16 detectives are carrying more than 400 cases each this year, and many others have loads in the high 300s, even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts. When they are assigned a homicide, they typically have four days to investigate before dealing with other cases. Quieter precincts can give detectives a month with little distraction to investigate a murder. Detectives in the 40th Precinct have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through    Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   murders, rapes, felony assaults and robberies. By contrast, a detective in the precinct on the southern end of Staten Island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling Union Square and Gramercy Park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of Washington Heights handles 32, the citywide median. Last year, the 40th was the    for violent crime, with 65 cases per detective. In the Bronx as a whole, a precinct detective has carried an average of 58 violent felonies this year, compared with 27 in Manhattan, 37 in Brooklyn, 38 in Queens and 25 on Staten Island. Rape cases and robbery patterns are later sent to more specialized units, but precinct detectives do extensive initial work to interview victims, write reports and process evidence. Precincts in much of Manhattan, which are whiter and wealthier than the South Bronx, often have more property felonies, like stolen laptops or credit cards, and the police say those can be complex. But even accounting for those crimes, the 40th Precinct has some of the heaviest caseloads of overall crime per detective in the city. Michael Palladino, the head of the DetectivesÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ Endowment Association and a former Bronx officer, said staffing disparities affected the departmentÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s efforts to build trust in communities like the South Bronx. Witnesses make a calculation, he said: Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍIf I cooperate with the detectives, thereÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s so much work, thereÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s so few of them there, they wonÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t even get the chance to protect me, or theyÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ll be there too late when the retaliation comes. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Sergeant LoPuzzo, who turned down a more prestigious post to stay in the 40th Precinct, said that his squad worked tirelessly to handle cases with the people he had, and that while every squad wanted more detectives, staffing needs for counterterrorism units and task forces had created new deployment challenges across the department. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍWe fight with the army we have, not the army we wish we had,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he said. Details of how the Police Department assigns its 36, 000 officers are closely held and constantly in flux, and the public has minimal information on how personnel are allocated. Presented with The TimesÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s analysis of confidential staffing data, the departmentÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, vowed to send more detectives to the 40th Precinct and said the department would reassess its deployment more broadly in troubled precincts. He said a recent decision to bring gang, narcotics and vice detectives under his command made it easier to shift personnel. Chief Boyce said the burdens on detectives went beyond felony crimes to include   and   cases. And he noted the support that precinct squads got from centralized units focusing on robberies, gangs or grand larcenies, for example. Major crime keeps pounding the 40th Precinct, at rates that in 2015 were only a tenth of a percent lower than in 2001, even as citywide crime dropped by more than a third over the same period. But the precinctÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s detective squad shrank by about eight investigators during those years, according to staffing data obtained from the City Council through a Freedom of Information Law request. The squad covering Union Square and Gramercy Park, where crime dropped by a third over that period, grew by about 11 investigators. (The 40th Precinct was given an additional detective and four   investigators this summer, when it was already missing three detectives for illness or other reasons.) Retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the cityÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s last Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ the busiest precincts. Rather, they say, the Police Department should be dedicating more resources to providing the same sort of robust investigative response that seems standard in Manhattan. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍAny crime in Manhattan has to be solved,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ said Howard Landesberg, who was a 40th Precinct detective in the late 1980s. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThe outer boroughs are, like, forgotten. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Retired detectives said that understaffing made it harder to solve crimes in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, where the higher prevalence of gang and drug killings already saddled investigators with cases in which people were not inclined to cooperate. Through   detectives had closed 67 percent of homicides in Manhattan and 76 percent of those in Staten Island this year, compared with 54 percent of those in the Bronx, 42 percent of those in Queens and 31 percent of those in Brooklyn. Of last yearÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s homicides, detectives cleared 71 percent in Manhattan, 63 percent in the Bronx, 62 percent in Queens, 57 percent in Staten Island and 31 percent in Brooklyn. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍItÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s the culture of the Police Department that they worry about Manhattan,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ said Joseph L. Giacalone, a former sergeant in the Bronx Cold Case Squad, in part Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍbecause thatÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s where the money is. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ He added: Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍWhen de Blasio came in, he talked about the tale of two cities. And then heÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s done the complete opposite of what he said. ItÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s just business as usual. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ The BronxÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s struggles extend into prosecutions. In each of the last five years, prosecutors in the Bronx have declined to prosecute violent felony cases more than anywhere else in the city. And the rate of conviction in the Bronx is routinely the lowest in the city as well, but has ticked up this year to surpass BrooklynÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s rate through November as Bronx prosecutors work to streamline cases. Some cases have become even more difficult to win because of the   problem in the 40th Precinct, which has allowed defense lawyers to attack the credibility of officers who were implicated, said Patrice OÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_Shaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the Bronx District AttorneyÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s office. The district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, elected in 2015, said in a statement, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI was a judge here in the Bronx, and I heard from jurors that they canÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t be impartial because they donÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t trust the police. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Against that tide of mistrust, Sergeant LoPuzzoÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s detectives work 36 hours straight on some fresh cases. They buy Chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect. They carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer. They buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered sonÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s ashes in a box. In the months after a killing, they can seem like the only people in this glittering city who are paying attention to the 40th PrecinctÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s homicide victims. Newly fatherless children go back to school without a therapistÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s help. VictimsÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance. Newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts, pushing them down the priority lists of the   chiefs at Police Headquarters. In a stuffy   squad room, the detectives of the 40th Precinct grapple with an inheritance of government neglect. They meet mothers who believe their sons might never have been murdered had a city guidance counselor listened to pleas to help them stay enrolled, or had a city housing worker fixed the locks or lights on a building. And the detectives work alongside a vicious system on the streets for punishing police cooperators. Young men scan court paperwork in prison, looking for the names of people who turned on them. One murder victim in the precinct this year was cast out of his crew after he avoided being arrested with them in a gang takedown some believed he was cooperating. A longtime 40th Precinct detective, Jeff Meenagh, said a witness in a homicide case was going to testify until he went back to his neighborhood and was told that anyone who testified would Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍget what you deserve. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ The allies Sergeant LoPuzzo makes are friendly only for so long. He helped clear a womanÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s son of a robbery charge by locating surveillance video that proved he was not the robber. The mother started calling with tips under a code name  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   about a gun under a car, for example. But she always refused to testify. And she cut ties this year after Sergeant LoPuzzo arrested her son in the stabbing of two people and her   in a shooting. New York City owns East 146th Street and the   buildings on each side. But James Fernandez, in the Betances Houses, said the reality on the ground was different: The drug boss ran the block. By October, Mr. Fernandez was increasingly afraid  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   and fed up. Mr. Fernandez and his wife went so far as to give officers keys to the building door, so they could get in whenever they wanted, showed them the videos and offered them   access to his camera so they could see what was happening in the hallway. A couple of officers said they needed a supervisorÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s permission to do more. Others answered that the young men were only making threats. Officers occasionally stopped outside their building, causing the young men to scatter, but did not come inside, Mr. Fernandez said. The menacing worsened. Mr. FernandezÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s daughter was harassed as she arrived home from school. She grew more and more distressed, and her parents had her start seeing a therapist. Mr. Fernandez made several complaints at the office of the borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr. and visited a victimÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s advocate in the district attorneyÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s office. On Oct. 20, 2015, he sent an online note to the police commissionerÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s office. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍWe went to all proper channels for help,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ the note said. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍBoth precincts failed us, except 2 officers who helped us, but their hands are tied. No one else to turn to. I have months of video of multiple crimes taking place and we are in extreme danger. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ40th and PSA 7 wonÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t do anything,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he wrote, referring to the local substation. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍPlease we need to speak to some one with authority. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ The local substation commander, Deputy Inspector Jerry OÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_Sullivan, and the Bronx narcotics unit were alerted to the complaints. But Mr. Fernandez said he never heard from them. So he relied on his own street instincts to protect his family. He made pleas to a man he thought was employing the dealers in the hallway. The activity quieted briefly, but it returned after the young men rented a room in a womanÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s apartment upstairs. Mr. Fernandez approached a different man who he learned was the boss of the operation. The man agreed to ask the dealers to calm down. He even hired a drug customer to sweep the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said. But two weeks later, the dealing and the harassment resumed. So he went to his old Lower East Side bosses, who hired men to trail his wife and daughter on their way out of the building and make sure they made it safely to school. At other times they sat outside the Betances Houses. He also bought two bulletproof vests, for about $700 each. He could not find one small enough for his daughter. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI have no faith in the City of New York, I have no faith in the police, I have no faith in the politicians,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Mr. Fernandez said. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThe only thing I know for sure: God, if weÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_re in a situation again, I will be left to defend my family. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Paying such close attention to what was happening in the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said he learned some details about two recent homicides that the 40th Precinct was investigating. But because his calls for help were going nowhere, he said he decided not to put himself in greater risk by talking: He would not tell the police what he had learned. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍIÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_m bending over backward, and nobodyÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s not even doing anything,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he said. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍWhy am I going to help you, if you ainÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t going to help me?Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ By last January, a new neighborhood coordination officer was working with residents of the Betances Houses, and ended up with the most arrests in his housing command, Inspector OÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_Sullivan said. Chief Boyce said that the silos in which gang and narcotics detectives used to work made responding to complaints more difficult, but that the recent restructuring would remove those obstacles. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍNo one should live like Mr. Fernandez lived, with people dealing drugs outside of his apartment,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he said. Mr. FernandezÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s complaints did not spur any arrests, but two men from the hallway were caught separately this year in shootings. One of them, whom Mr. Fernandez named in a police report, was charged this summer with hitting an officer with a metal folding chair and firing three gunshots into a crowd, court papers say. He is being held on Rikers Island on an attempted murder charge. That was too late for Mr. Fernandez. By May, he had moved his family away.","When Walt DisneyÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍBambiÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ opened in 1942, critics praised its spare, haunting visual style, vastly different from anything Disney had done before. But what they did not know was that the filmÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s striking appearance had been created by a Chinese immigrant artist, who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the Song dynasty. The extent of his contribution to Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍBambi,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ which remains a   mark for film animation, would not be widely known for decades. Like the filmÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s title character, the artist, Tyrus Wong, weathered irrevocable separation from his mother  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   and, in the hope of making a life in America, incarceration, isolation and rigorous interrogation  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   all when he was still a child. In the years that followed, he endured poverty, discrimination and chronic lack of recognition, not only for his work at Disney but also for his fine art, before finding acclaim in his 90s. Mr. Wong died on Friday at 106. A Hollywood studio artist, painter, printmaker, calligrapher,   illustrator and, in later years, maker of fantastical kites, he was one of the most celebrated   artists of the 20th century. But because of the marginalization to which   were long subject, he passed much of his career unknown to the general public. Artistic recognition, when Mr. Wong did find it, was all the more noteworthy for the fact that among Chinese immigrant men of his generation, professional prospects were largely limited to menial jobs like houseboy and laundryman. Trained as a painter, Mr. Wong was a leading figure in the Modernist movement that flourished in California between the first and second World Wars. In 1932 and again in 1934, his work was included in group shows at the Art Institute of Chicago that also featured Picasso, Matisse and Paul Klee. As a staff artist for Hollywood studios from the 1930s to the 1960s, he drew storyboards and made vibrant paintings, as detailed as any architectural illustrations, that helped the director envision each scene before it was shot. Over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for Disney and   films for Warner Brothers and other studios, among them Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThe Sands of Iwo JimaÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ (1949) Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍRebel Without a CauseÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ (1955) and Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThe Wild BunchÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ (1969). But of the dozens of films on which he worked, it was for Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍBambiÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ that Mr. Wong was  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   belatedly  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   most renowned. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍHe was truly involved with every phase of production,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ John Canemaker, an   animator and a historian of animation at New York University, said in an interview for this obituary in March. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍHe created an art direction that had really never been seen before in animation. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ In 2013 and 2014, Mr. Wong was the subject of Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍWater to Paper, Paint to Sky,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ a major retrospective at the Disney Family Museum in San Francisco. From the museumÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s windows, which overlook San Francisco Bay, he could contemplate Angel Island, where more than nine decades earlier, as a lone    he had sought to gain admission to a country that adamantly did not want him. Wong Gen Yeo (the name is sometimes Romanized Wong Gaing Yoo) was born on Oct. 25, 1910, in a farming village in Guangdong Province. As a young child, he already exhibited a love of drawing and was encouraged by his father. In 1920, seeking better economic prospects, Gen Yeo and his father embarked for the United States, leaving his mother and sister behind. Gen Yeo would never see his mother again. They were obliged to travel under false identities  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   a state of affairs known among Chinese immigrants as being a Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍpaper sonÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   in the hope of circumventing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur, the act, which drastically curtailed the number of Chinese people allowed to enter the country, was among the earliest United States laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration. But in 1906, an unforeseen loophole opened in the form of the San Francisco earthquake and fire. Because a huge number of municipal documents, including birth and immigration records, were destroyed, many newly arrived Chinese capitalized on the loss, maintaining that they had been born in San Francisco before the fire. As United States citizens, they were entitled to bring over their relatives  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   or, in the case of Gen Yeo and his father, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍpaper sonsÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ posing as relatives. Attuned to the deception, United States immigration officials put Chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be. The questions came like gunfire: In which direction does your village face? How many windows are in your house? Where in the house is the rice bin? How wide is your well? How deep? Are there trees in your village? Are there lakes? What shops can you name? The sponsoring relative was interrogated separately, and the answers had to match. For the new arrival, a major mistake, or a series of smaller ones, could mean deportation. To stand a chance of passing, aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers. The ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults.    Gen Yeo would undergo it alone. On Dec. 30, 1920, after a month at sea, the Wongs landed at Angel Island Immigration Station. The elder Mr. Wong was traveling as a merchant named Look Get his son as Look Tai Yow. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍAngel Island is considered to be the Ellis Island of the West Coast,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Lisa See, the author of Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍOn Gold MountainÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ (1995) a nonfiction chronicle of her   family, said in an interview in 2016. However, she continued: Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThe goal was really very different than Ellis Island, which was supposed to be so welcoming. Angel Island opened very specifically to keep the Chinese out. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Because Mr. WongÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s father had previously lived in the United States as Look Get, he was able to clear Immigration quickly. But as a new arrival, Gen Yeo was detained on the island for nearly a month, the only child among the immigrants being held there. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI was scared half to death I just cried,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Mr. Wong recalled in Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍTyrus,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ an   documentary directed by Pamela Tom, which premiered in 2015. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍEvery day is just miserable  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   miserable. I hated that place. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ On Jan. 27, 1921, in the presence of an interpreter and a stenographer, young Gen Yeo, posing as Look Tai Yow, was interrogated by three inspectors. His father had already been questioned. Gen Yeo was well prepared and answered without error. In Sacramento, where he joined his father, a schoolteacher Americanized Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍTai YowÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ to Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍTyrus,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ and he was known as Tyrus Wong ever after. Soon afterward, father and son were separated once more, when the elder Mr. Wong moved to Los Angeles to seek work. For reasons that have been lost to time, he could not take his son. Tyrus lived on his own in a Sacramento boardinghouse while attending elementary school. Two years later  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   possibly more  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   Tyrus traveled to Los Angeles to join his father, who had found work in a gambling den. They lived in a   boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel. After school, Tyrus worked as a houseboy for two Pasadena families, earning 50 cents a day. His first art teacher was his father, who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper: They could not afford ink or drawing paper. When Tyrus was in junior high, a teacher, noting his drawing talent, arranged a summer scholarship to the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. By his own account an indifferent student in public school, Tyrus found his calling at the institute, now the Otis College of Art and Design. When his scholarship ended he declined to return to junior high. His father scraped together the $90 tuition  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   a small fortune  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   to let him stay on as OtisÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s youngest student. He studied there for at least five years, simultaneously working as the school janitor, before graduating in the 1930s. Not long afterward his father died, leaving young Mr. Wong entirely on his own. From 1936 to 1938, Mr. Wong was an artist for the Works Progress Administration, creating paintings for libraries and other public spaces. With friends, including the   artist Benji Okubo, he founded the Oriental ArtistsÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ Group of Los Angeles, which organized exhibitions of membersÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ work  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   an   level of exposure for Asian artists at the time. Mr. Wong, newly married and needing steady work, joined Disney in 1938 as an Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ creating the thousands of intermediate drawings that bring animated sequences to life. Asians were then a novelty at Hollywood studios, and Mr. Wong was made keenly aware of the fact, first at Disney and later at Warner Brothers. One   flung a racial epithet at him. Another assumed on sight that he worked in the company cafeteria. Then there was the affront of the  Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s job itself: Painstaking, repetitive and for Mr. Wong quickly   it is the   work of animation  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍa terrible use of his talents as a landscape artist and a painter,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Mr. Canemaker said. A reprieve came in the late 1930s, when Mr. Wong learned that Disney was adapting Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍBambi, a Life in the Woods,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ the 1923 novel by the Austrian writer Felix Salten about a fawn whose mother is killed by a hunter. In trying to animate the book, Disney had reached an impasse. The studio had enjoyed great success in 1937 with its animated film Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ a baroque production in which every detail of the backgrounds  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   every petal on every flower, every leaf on every tree  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   was meticulously represented. In an attempt to use a similar style for Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍBambi,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ it found that the ornate backgrounds camouflaged the deer and other forest creatures on which the narrative centered. Mr. Wong spied his chance. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI said, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍöGee, this is all outdoor scenery,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he recalled in a video interview years afterward, adding: Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI said, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍöGee, IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_m a landscape painter! Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Invoking the exquisite landscape paintings of the Song dynasty (A. D. 960 Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  1279) he rendered in watercolors and pastels a series of nature scenes that were moody, lyrical and atmospheric  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   at once lush and spare  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   with backgrounds subtly suggested by a stroke or two of the brush. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍWalt Disney went crazy over them,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ said Mr. Canemaker, who wrote about Mr. Wong in his book Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍBefore the Animation Begins: The Art and Lives of Disney Inspirational Sketch ArtistsÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ (1996). Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍHe said, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍöI love this indefinite quality, the mysterious quality of the forest. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Mr. Wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍBut he was more than that,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Mr. Canemaker explained. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍHe was the designer he was the person they went to when they had questions about the color, about how to lay something out. He even influenced the music and the special effects: Just by the look of the drawings, he inspired people. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Mr. Wong spent two years painting the illustrations that would inform every aspect of Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍBambi. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Throughout the finished film  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   lent a brooding quality by its stark landscapes misty, desaturated palette and figures often seen in silhouette  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   his influence is unmistakable. But in 1941, in the wake of a bitter employeesÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ strike that year, Disney fired Mr. Wong. Though he had chosen not to strike  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   he felt the studio had been good to him, Mr. Canemaker said  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   he was let go amid the lingering climate of   resentments. On Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍBambi,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Mr. WongÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s name appears, quite far down in the credits, as a mere Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍbackgroundÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ artist. Mr. Wong joined Warner Brothers in 1942, working there  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   and lent out on occasion to other studios  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   until his retirement in 1968. The indignities he endured were not confined to the studios. Trying to buy a house, he and his wife, the former Ruth Kim, were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThen in a month youÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_d go back there and the sign was still there,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Mr. Wong recalled in Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍTyrus. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Mr. Wong, like many   took to wearing a lapel button proclaiming his heritage, lest an angry American beat him up on the street. The war permanently dispersed the fledgling Oriental ArtistsÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ Group. Mr. WongÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s friend Mr. Okubo was sent, with tens of thousands of other   to an internment camp. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍIf World War II hadnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t happened when it did, I think these artists, even the   artists, would have more of a name than they do today,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Ms. See said. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍAnd thatÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Mr. Wong, who became a United States citizen in 1946, also designed Christmas cards for Hallmark and painted elegant   designs on dinnerware, now sought after by collectors. A longtime resident of Sunland, Calif. he became, in retirement, a renowned kitemaker, designing, building and hand coloring astonishing, airworthy creations  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   butterflies, swallows, whole flocks of owls, centipedes more than 100 feet long  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   that streaked the Southern California sky like paint on blue canvas. During the last 15 years of Ruth WongÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s life, when she was ill with dementia, Mr. Wong forsook his work to care for her. After her death in 1995, he slowly began making art again. In 2001, in formal recognition of his influence on Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍBambi,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Mr. Wong was named a Disney Legend. The honor  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   whose previous recipients include Fred MacMurray, Julie Andrews and Annette Funicello  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   is bestowed by the Walt Disney Company for outstanding contributions. In 2003, a retrospective of his work, curated in part by Ms. See, was the inaugural exhibition at the Chinese American Museum in Los Angeles. The Disney Family MuseumÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s retrospective, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍWater to Paper, Paint to Sky,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ traveled in 2015 to the Museum of Chinese in America, in Lower Manhattan. Mr. WongÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s death, at his home in Sunland, was confirmed by the filmmaker Ms. Tom. His survivors include three daughters, Kay Fong,   Wong and Kim Wong and two grandchildren. When his daughters were small, Mr. Wong encouraged them to make art, as his father had encouraged him. Yet he would not let them have coloring books. The reason was simple: He did not want his children constrained, he said, by lines laid down by others.","Death may be the great equalizer, but it isnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t necessarily evenhanded. Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports and the      Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   the pop music world had, hands down, the bleakest year. Start with David Bowie, whose stage persona  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   androgynous glam rocker, dance pop star, electronic experimentalist  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   was as   as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue. Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis. Death came to him at 57, and by all indications no one, including Prince Rogers Nelson, had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too? Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   I hesitate to say merry  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   way, ever the wise,   troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍUntil then, hereÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s another song. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ It was as if 2016 hadnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another   death. George Michael, the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas. Pop music figures fell all year, many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people canÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t bear to throw out. The roster included Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake and Palmer Glenn Frey of the Eagles and Maurice White of Earth, Wind  Fire. Leon Russell, the piano pounder with a Delta blues wail and a mountain manÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s mass of hair, died. So did Merle Haggard, rugged country poet of the common man and the   outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to ElvisÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s swiveling hips in the early days: Scotty Moore. And then there was George Martin, whose   genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of John, Paul, George and Ringo (and, by extension, on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle. If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as Ali. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way. Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking   and, yes, his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring. Palmer, too, was transformational, golfÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s first media star. The gentlemanÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of   postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too. He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   but he was somehow one of them, too. The same was said of Gordie Howe, Mr. Hockey, a son of the Saskatchewan prairie who tore up the National Hockey League, hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88 and of Ralph Branca, a trolley car conductorÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   his, the fastball to Bobby Thomson that decided the 1951 National League pennant  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   can sometimes never be lived down. Pat Summitt, the coach who elevated womenÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s basketball, led her Tennessee teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach, could not defeat AlzheimerÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s disease, dying at 64. And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras. Clyde Lovelette, an Olympic, college and N. B. A. champion who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men, was 86 his hardwood heir Nate Thurmond, a defensive stalwart who battled Russell, Wilt and Kareem in the paint in a   Hall of Fame career, was 74. Even older, in the baseball ranks, was Monte Irvin. When he died at 96, there were few people still around who could remember watching him play, particularly in his prime, in the 1940s, when he was a star on the Negro circuit but barred from the   major leagues. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League BaseballÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s first black executive, but when he died, fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if? A different question, in an entirely different sphere, arose after the stunning news that Justice Antonin Scalia had died on a hunting trip in Texas: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country. Other exits from the public stage returned us to the past. Nancy ReaganÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s death evoked the 1980s White House, where   glamour and   West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the Potomac. John GlennÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s had us thinking again about a   burst of national pride soaring into outer space. The deaths of Tom Hayden and Daniel Berrigan, avatars of defiance, harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam WarÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s roiling home front. Phyllis SchlaflyÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wingÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s ascension in American politics. The death of Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general, recalled the Clinton years, all eight of them, from the firestorm at Waco, Tex. to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named EliÍïÍ ÍâÍn GonzÍïÍ ÍâÍlez, to the bitter Senate battle over impeachment. On other shores, Fidel CastroÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution, nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a   strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of Boutros   the Egyptian diplomat who led the United Nations, led to replayed nightmares of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. The death of Shimon Peres removed a last link to the very founding of Israel and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of Elie Wiesel, in New York, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz. If writers, too, are   even in fiction, then the world is poorer without the literary voices of Harper Lee, Umberto Eco, Pat Conroy, Jim Harrison, Anita Brookner, Alvin Toffler, Gloria Naylor and William Trevor, not to mention the playwrights Peter Shaffer, Dario Fo and,   Edward Albee  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   all dead in 2016. But just as treasured were those who spun   for our viewing pleasure  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   none more lustily than Ms. Fisher, the     Princess Leia of the Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍStar WarsÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ tales. Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Ms. Reynolds, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a motherÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s grief. Devotees of the Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍHarry PotterÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ movies were saddened by the death of Alan Rickman, who played the deliciously dour professor Severus Snape in that blockbuster franchise but whose career, on both stage and screen, was far richer than many of SnapeÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s younger fans may have known. Zsa Zsa GaborÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s celebrity, by contrast, outshone a modest acting career. Gene Wilder and Garry Shandling died in the same year, both having perfected a brand of hilariously neurotic comedy fit for a   culture. And this time Abe Vigoda, of the Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍGodfatherÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ movies and Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍBarney Miller,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had. On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: Jacques Rivette, the French New Wave auteur, with his   meditations on life and art Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian master, with his searching examinations of ordinary lives Andrzej Wajda, a rival to Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa in some criticsÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ eyes, with his haunting tales of Poland under the boot first of Nazis and then of Communists. A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on, images of their younger selves frozen in time: Noel Neill (Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍAdventures of SupermanÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ) Alan Young (Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍMister EdÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ) Robert Vaughn (Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThe Man From U. N. C. L. E. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ) William Schallert and Patty Duke (father and daughter on Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThe Patty Duke ShowÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ) Dan Haggerty (Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThe Life and Times of Grizzly AdamsÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ) Florence Henderson (Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThe Brady BunchÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ) and Alan Thicke (Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍGrowing PainsÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ). And Garry Marshall, the creative force who practically owned prime time with Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍHappy Days,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍMork  Mindy,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍLaverne  ShirleyÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ and more, died at 81. On Broadway, lights were dimmed in memory of Brian Bedford, Tammy Grimes and Anne Jackson, all brilliant in their day. The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. The street photographer Bill Cunningham, who found fashion statements on every corner, was suddenly missing, making Manhattan, overnight, a less idiosyncratic, less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French workerÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s jacket with a camera slung around his neck  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   what a picture!  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   had split from the scene. So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art in recording the last half of the 20th century: Ruth Gruber, Marc Riboud, Louis Stettner and more. And so had the TV journalists Morley Safer and Gwen Ifill and the TV commentator John McLaughlin, all of whom had tried to make sense of it. MusicÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s other precincts were emptier without the conductor and revolutionary composer Pierre Boulez and the new music soprano Phyllis Curtin the jazz artists Mose Allison, Bobby Hutcherson and Gato Barbieri the rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor) and the Latin megastar Juan Gabriel. Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in Andrew S. Grove, who led the semiconductor revolution at Intel. The television industry lost a   executive, Grant Tinker, who in the Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_80s made NBC the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics, and the smaller world of women in science, said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in Vera Rubin. And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude. Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to Marion Pritchard. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a   gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s, in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding. By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyoneÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s guess. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives.","SEOUL, South Korea  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   North KoreaÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s leader, Kim   said on Sunday that his country was making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   a bold statement less than a month before the inauguration of   Donald J. Trump. Although North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the last decade and more than 20 ballistic missile tests in 2016 alone, and although it habitually threatens to attack the United States with nuclear weapons, the country has never   an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. In his annual New YearÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s Day speech, which was broadcast on the NorthÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s   KCTV on Sunday, Mr. Kim spoke proudly of the strides he said his country had made in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. He said North Korea would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as the United States remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with South Korea. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍWe have reached the final stage in preparations to   an intercontinental ballistic rocket,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he said. Analysts in the region have said Mr. Kim might conduct another weapons test in coming months, taking advantage of leadership changes in the United States and South Korea. Mr. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20. In South Korea, President Park   whose powers were suspended in a Parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9, is waiting for the Constitutional Court to rule on whether she should be formally removed from office or reinstated. If North Korea conducts a    test in coming months, it will test Mr. TrumpÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s new administration despite years of increasingly harsh sanctions, North Korea has been advancing toward Mr. KimÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s professed goal of arming his isolated country with the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States. Mr. KimÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s speech on Sunday indicated that North Korea may   a   rocket several times this year to complete its ICBM program, said Cheong   a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. The first of such tests could come even before Mr. TrumpÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s inauguration, Mr. Cheong said. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍWe need to take note of the fact that this is the first New YearÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s speech where Kim   mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he said. In his speech, Mr. Kim did not comment on Mr. TrumpÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s election. Doubt still runs deep that North Korea has mastered all the technology needed to build a reliable ICBM. But analysts in the region said the NorthÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s launchings of   rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles. After the NorthÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s satellite launch in February, South Korean defense officials said the Unha rocket used in the launch, if successfully reconfigured as a missile, could fly more than 7, 400 miles with a warhead of 1, 100 to 1, 300 pounds  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   far enough to reach most of the United States. North Korea has deployed Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of South Korea and Japan, but it has had a spotty record in   the Musudan, its   ballistic missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in the Pacific, including those on Guam. The North has also claimed a series of successes in testing various ICBM technologies, although its claims cannot be verified and are often disputed by officials and analysts in the region. It has said it could now make nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile. It also claimed success in testing the   technology that allows a   missile to return to the EarthÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s atmosphere without breaking up. In April, North Korea reported the successful ground test of an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile. At the time, Mr. Kim said the North Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍcan tip   intercontinental ballistic rockets with more powerful nuclear warheads and keep any cesspool of evils in the Earth, including the U. S. mainland, within our striking range. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ On Sept. 9, the North conducted its fifth, and most powerful, nuclear test. Mr. Kim later attended another ground test of a new   rocket engine, exhorting his government to prepare for another rocket launch as soon as possible. In November, the United Nations Security Council imposed new  sanctions against the North.",0.02397431753624454,0.02397431753624454,0.7518284145438277,0.20022295038368318,0.99776,0.0,0,0,2171.6

Patriots Day takes an unexpectedly cynical view of the chaos, rash   and bureaucratic infighting that followed the bombing Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  the question is whether that was BergÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s intended message. For its grim   running time, the movie celebrates the men on the ground who helped bring the bombers to justice, but itÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s the glimpses of something more complicated than jingoism that really linger. The scene that best illustrates this dichotomy comes late in Patriots Day. As the search for one of the bombers, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, intensifies, his brotherÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s wife Katherine (Melissa Benoist) is brought in for interrogation on her connections to the case. As she asks for a lawyer, protesting that she Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍhas rights,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ her steely interviewer (Khandi Alexander) tuts, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍHoney, you ainÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t got shit. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ ItÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s a Hollywood line intended to provoke a big cheer from the audience, despite its queasy legal undertones. But the film presents it as just that Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  a cheesy line. The questioning goes nowhere, and the interrogator exits with a shrug as the movie notes in its   Katherine was never charged with any crime. Patriots Day is filled with this kind of bluster, but the filmÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s most compelling moments serve to undercut it. Deepwater Horizon Stays Too Close to the Surface, Working against those more interesting themes is the man at the center of the movie, Boston Police Sergeant Tommy Saunders, a fictional character invented to serve as the audienceÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s eyes and ears at every major turning point of the attacks. HeÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s played by Mark Wahlberg, the polestar of BergÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s new genre of   storytelling who has played the mouthy heroes at the center of Lone Survivor (2013) Deepwater Horizon (2016) and now Patriots Day. Unlike those other films, WahlbergÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s character in Patriots Day didnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t really exist, and he often comes across as a bundle of screenwriting clichÍïÍ Íâ©s. HeÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s nursing a bum knee and was recently demoted due to insubordination, but somehow is on   terms with every cop, uniformed or otherwise, in the city. When the film is focused on Saunders, as it mostly is, it feels like a straight recreation of a traumatic event that occurred less than four years ago. Berg largely does well to avoid sensationalizing the 2013 bombing, which killed 3 and wounded 264 others, and the subsequent manhunt that claimed the life of a police officer. At no point does Patriots Day feel like a glitzy action movie or a gory piece of horror. The violence of that day is not lingered on, outside of an effort to make its victims feel like real people by depicting snippets of their lives beforehand. Wahlberg, for his part, canÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t help but make Saunders feel like a bit of a stereotype heÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s a     movie cop in a film thatÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s otherwise seeking nuance. Saunders, it seems, is supposed to stand in for the generally lovable, belligerent Boston spirit that prevailed in the days after the marathon, and Berg drills that point home far too many times. There are bits that work Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  in the immediate aftermath of the bombs, Wahlberg successfully communicates how angry and shaken Saunders is, rather than switching into    hero mode. He does a decent job selling the trauma, but once his hefty attitude returns, Patriots Day snaps back to severe unreality. ThatÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s too bad, since the film is most fascinating when it faithfully conveys the confusion of the days after the bombing, and the   of differing opinions and clashing egos. The FBI, led by    agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon) takes over the case, recreating the blocks attacked with   bombs inside a gigantic warehouse and combing through surveillance videos for clues. Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman) Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick (Michael Beach) and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino (Vincent Curatola) gather there to offer their own guidance on the case. Saunders is present too, for some reason, mostly providing expertise on the businesses around Boylston Street. The thorny, mucky,   debates that played out during the manhunt are the best parts of the film. Berg accurately shows DesLauriers agonizing over whether to release the pictures of the Tsarnaev brothers gleaned from surveillance cameras before heÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s fully substantiated that theyÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_re the bombers his hand is eventually forced by a leak to the media. That sets into action the series of events that led to a deadly shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers in Watertown (J. K. Simmons plays a police sergeant there). Berg is wise to delve into the utter chaos of that manhunt, which included a brief, informal declaration of martial law and a bizarre, bloody standoff with the brothers that saw them lobbing pipe bombs at cop cars. ItÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s bedlam, in other words Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  total disorder and madness, the kind of violence and fear that terrorism is intended to provoke, even from those trying to stop it. The Boston PDÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s efforts to capture the Tsarnaev brothers is justly depicted as heroic, but itÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s the crazed   the random chains of events, and the empty, angry posturing that stick out as most worthy of analysis. If Berg had dug deeper, he could have had a great film on his hands as it stands, heÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s delivered a rote, but occasionally   misfire.","In Norse mythology, humans and our world were created by a pantheon of gods who lived in the realm of Asgard. As it turns out, these stories have a grain of truth to them. Thanks to a team of scientists led by Thijs Ettema, Asgard is now also the name of a large clan of microbes. Its members, which are named after Norse gods like Odin, Thor, Loki, and Heimdall, are found all over the world. Many of them are rare and no one has actually seen them under a microscope. But thanks to their DNA, we know they exist. And we know that they are singularly important to us, because they may well be the group from which we evolved. If Ettema is right, then around two billion years ago, an Asgardian microbe (or an incredibly close relative) took part in a unique event that gave rise to the eukaryotes. ThatÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s the group which includes humans, our fellow animals, plants, fungi, and every living thing made from large, complex cells Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  all the living things weÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_re most familiar with, and all the ones we can actually see. Our origins lie either in Asgard, or next door to it.   To understand this story, we have to go back to the very beginning. The Earth was created around 4. 5 billion years ago, and judging by some astonishingly ancient fossils, life emerged relatively soon after. For the longest time, living things belonged to two great domains: the bacteria and the archaea, both microscopic and both comprising single cells. That was the status quo for at least 1. 7 billion years, until the two domains were joined by a third: the eukaryotes. And they were very different. Eukaryotic cells are generally much bigger than either bacteria or archaea. They also have larger genomes. They have internal compartments that act like our organs, each with its own special job. They have an internal skeleton that acts as a transport network for molecules. ThereÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s this huge gulf of complexity that separates them from the other two domains. ItÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s a gulf that has only ever been crossed once in lifeÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s history. Bacteria and archaea are capable of amazing feats of evolution, but in over 3. 7 billion years of existence, none of them have ever evolved into anything approaching a   cell Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  except that one time. Why?   One possible answer, which IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ve written about before, says that eukaryotes were created through an incredibly unlikely merger between members of the other two domains. Somehow, a bacterium found its way inside an archaeon and, rather than being digested or destroyed, became a permanent part of its host. In doing so, it provided the archaeon with an extra source of energy, which allowed it to get bigger, accumulate more genes, and evolve down new paths that were previously inaccessible to it. That fusion cell gave rise to the eukaryotes, and the bacterium eventually turned into the mitochondria Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  little   structures that still power eukaryotic cells to this day. Once the eukaryotes evolved, they repeatedly engulf microbes and fused with them Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  a process called endosymbiosis. But thatÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s much easier to do when the host cell is already big, and can engulf smaller neighbors. If the host is an archaeon, the feat becomes much harder and far more improbable. ThatÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s maybe why the merger between an archaeon and a bacterium Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  the one that gave rise to mitochondria and may have spawned the eukaryotes Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  has only happened once. What were those two ancient partners like? We know that the bacterium belonged to a group called the alphaproteobacteria (which also includes Wolbachia, a microbe that IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ve repeatedly written about here.) But until recently, no one knew anything about the archaeon host.   Ettema changed that in 2015. His team at Uppsala University collected samples of sediment from LokiÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s Castle Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  a field of hydrothermal vents that lie between Greenland and Norway, at depths of 2, 300 meters. By analyzing the DNA within their sample, the team identified a new archaeon that they called Lokiarchaeota (     ). Their DNA revealed that they are the closest living relatives of all eukaryotes. TheyÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_re the best approximations that we have for that ancestral archaeon that gave rise to us all. Loki isnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t alone. Last year, another group led by Brett Baker at the University of Texas in Austin discovered a related group of archaea in the mud of North CarolinaÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s White Oak River continuing the theme, they called it Thorarchaeota. Now, by teaming up, Ettema, Baker, and others have found even more relatives in sites around the world: Yellowstone National Park, a hot spring in New Zealand,   vents lying near a Japanese island, and many more. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThis work is fantastic: going out to the sediments of the planet and digging up the weird and wonderful bugs that live there,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ says James McInerney from the University of Manchester. These microbes fall into four major groups: Lokiarchaeota, Thorarchaeota, Odinarchaeota, and Heimdallarchaeota. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThereÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s around 50 more Asgardian gods, weÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_re good to go for the next few years,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ says Ettema. These four lineages all belong to an overarching supergroup that the team have called Asgard. And we eukaryotes either sit within the Asgardian family tree, or just outside it. We descend directly from either members of the group (perhaps within the Heimdall branch) or from incredibly close relatives. The genomes of the Asgardian microbes hold many surprises. When Ettema looked at their DNA, he was surprised to find genes that are supposedly unique to eukaryotes. Some are for building and remodeling internal skeletons, which archaea donÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t have. Others are involved in pinching off bits of the outer membrane to create little pockets that can move molecules around large cells Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  and yet, archaea are small. Yet others are typically involved in shuttling molecules between the compartments inside eukaryotic cells Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  compartments that typically donÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t exist in archaea. When Ettema first found these genes in Loki two years ago, other scientists were skeptical. Perhaps they came from eukaryotes that had contaminated EttemaÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s samples. But the presence of such genes in other members of Asgard, collected by different teams from different corners of the world, suggests that theyÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_re real. This doesnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t mean that the Asgardians are eukaryotes themselves, or even anything close. As James McInernery and Mary OÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_Connell write, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThe distribution of genes formerly thought to be   is patchy,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ so that no single Asgardian has Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍa full set. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Instead, it seems that Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍthe building blocks for those   traits were most likely already present in our archaeal ancestors,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ says Ettema. This feeds into a   and still unsettled debate about the origin of eukaryotes. Some scientists believe that the bacterium that would become the mitochondria was swallowed by a host cell that was already big, complex, and most of the way to becoming a eukaryote. Others hold that the host was still a true archaeon, and that it was the merger that allowed it to become more complex. On the face of it, the presence of   genes in Asgard supports the former idea. But Ettema disagrees. Based on their genomes, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍtheyÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_re not very sophisticated cells, but they have many of the right components in place,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he says. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThey were primed to become eukaryotes. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ This debate is likely to rage on for a while, because no one has actually seen the Asgardians themselves. In the 1980s, scientists developed ways of identifying microbes by searching for their DNA amid environmental samples. This is now the main way of finding new species, but it means that many microbes Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  like Loki and its kin Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  are only known through their DNA. No one knows what they look like. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍItÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s high on our priority list,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ says Ettema. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍItÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s crucial that we have a look at the cells to see what theyÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_re doing, but thatÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s extremely hard. Loki was discovered in   ocean sediments, where you donÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t go every day. Thor and Heimdall are present in shallower environments, but theyÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_re less than 0. 1 percent of the total microbial community. ItÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s like looking for a needle in a haystack, but weÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_re working on it. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ","Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍIf our democracy is to work in this increasingly diverse nation,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Barack Obama said in his farewell address last night, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍeach one of us must try to heed the advice of one of the great characters in American fiction, Atticus Finch. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ He then quoted Finch: Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . .. until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Chelsea ClintonÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s Apt Wrinkle in Time   In the moment, it occurred to some viewers that Finch also provided   quotes on diversity. Like, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍHave you ever considered that you canÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t have a set of backward people living among people advanced in one civilization and have a social Arcadia?Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Like, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍDo you want Negroes by the carload in our schools and churches and theaters?Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Like, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThe Negroes down here are still in their childhood as a people. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ The vision of Atticus Finch that Obama referenced was the upstanding one that Americans have idolized for decades, naming their sons and bars and   companies after him. That Finch is the lawyer and father of Harper LeeÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s To Kill a Mockingbird, who in the 1930s South defended a black man wrongly accused of rape and generally stood as a beacon of decency and tolerance. But Finch all along has been a more complicated figure than many recognize, with one line of academic inquiry arguing him as a paternalistic figure. Seeming to confirm that reading, in 2015 FinchÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s reputation took a hit with the publication of Go Set a Watchman, a newly unearthed manuscript by Lee telling of MockingbirdÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s characters 20 years after that novelÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s events. It wasnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t a sequel but rather a draft set apparently in a different reality, with details contradicting those of Mockingbird. And in it, an adult Scout Finch returns to Maycomb County, Alabama, to find her father, now 72, has become an outspoken racist. The novel follows her struggle to reconcile what she had seen in childhood with what had become of her dad and her hometown, where the civil rights movement had inflamed white hatred. ItÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s unlikely that Obama, or at least his speechwriters, didnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t know about these   complications for Atticus Finch. But it is possible they calculated that for most Americans, the enduring image of Finch is the one set by To Kill a Mockingbird in 1960, not the one from Go Set a Watchman. ItÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s also possible some more nuanced signaling was going on Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  a call for understanding with Trump supporters, and a call for the renewal of battered American ideals. The Finch quote came during a portion of ObamaÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s speech devoted to how racial tension poses a threat to democracy. While many of his remarks addressed the white majority that elected Donald Trump, he also asked Americans whoÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ve been discriminated against to show some empathy toward many of their antagonists. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍBlacks and other minoritiesÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ should be Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍtying our own struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he said, including that of Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍthe   white man who from the outside may seem like heÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s got all the advantages, but whoÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s seen his world upended by economic, cultural, and technological change. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ That admonition is much the kind of rhetoric that has often frustrated ObamaÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s liberal critics who say that heÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s been too evenhanded, too willing to engage in false equivalencies, to fully call out American racism. His speech took at least one shot at those critics: Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍIÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ve lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10, or 20, or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ By invoking Finch in the same section where he asked for empathy toward resentful white men, he is doubling down: For America to overcome the prejudices of people as bitter as the Watchman version of Finch, those people need to be understood. Whether you agree with that thought or not, itÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s a clever use of literary reference to push back at ObamaÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s critics to the left whoÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ve read his focus on incrementalism and individual change as capitulation. Many of those critics might have written off Finch even   Obama might have countered them by saying, not for the first time in his public life, that each personÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s empathy matters even in the face of an unjust system. More than anything, though, the invocation of a flawed American iconÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s enduring,   bit of wisdom underlines what ObamaÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s message was throughout the speech.

ObamaÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s words last night would have offered Scout comfort in the 1950s just as they offered comfort for his supporters in January 2017: Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍFor every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back.  But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all, and not just some. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Obama was not necessarily denying the troubling person Atticus Finch may have become, just as he was not denying the countryÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s troubling situation now. But he was calling on America to ensure that the best version of itself, and the best versions of its heroes, remerges.","Updated on January 11 at 5:05 p. m. In his first press conference since July 2016,   Donald Trump took only a few questions but made news on several fronts, saying he accepted the conclusion that Russia conducted hacks on top Democrats, bashing the press, and refusing once again to release his tax returns. Trump also refused to answer questions about whether any of his aides had been in contact with Russian officials, though he later said they had not as he departed the press conference. During the press conference, Trump announced a plan he said would answer concerns about conflicts of interest between the government and his business interests, yielding the stage to an attorney to explain the arrangement. The   was in combative mode, scolding reporters and the intelligence community and dodging several questions. He was asked early on about a pair of stories that emerged Tuesday night Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  one, from CNN, saying that he had been briefed on a memo that said Russia agents claimed to have compromising information on him, and a second, from BuzzFeed, that posted a dubious dossier of allegations. He blasted the publication of that dossier, and thanked news organizations that had not run it. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI read what was released, and I think it was a disgrace,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Trump said. He would not comment on whether he had been briefed on the material, saying briefings were classified, but he said the allegations contained in the memo and dossier were untrue. But Trump said for the first time that he believed the Kremlin had conducted the hacks against the Democratic National Committee and others, but he downplayed that particular action as just one of many. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍAs far as hacking I think it was Russia, but I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he said. (He later added, in response to a separate question, that it Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍcouldÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ve been others also. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ) Trump offered an ambiguous read on the publication of private material, on the one hand blasting the leak of the dossier to the press Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  an action that he pinned, without proof and probably incorrectly, on the intelligence community Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  while at the same time suggesting that the hacking of the DNC was bad but somewhat mitigated because of the information it revealed. The   refused to answer questions about whether any of his aides had been in contact with Russian officials, as some reports have stated. In an extremely tense exchange, he dismissed dogged questioning from CNNÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s Jim Acosta, saying, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍYou are fake news. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ As he left the press conference, however, he answered another reporter who reprised the question, saying, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍNo. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Trump insisted, despite copious reporting to the contrary as well as his own sonÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s statements, that he did not and never had business dealings in Russia. When a reporter asked him whether he would release his taxes to prove that, he once again demurred, claiming they are under audit. (He has not proved that claim, and the IRS says thereÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s nothing to prevent him from releasing taxes that are under audit.) Yet he also seemed to suggest that having won the election, he no longer had any incentive to release the returns. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThe only ones that care about my tax returns are the reporters,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he said. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI mean, I won! I became president!Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ (A recent Pew poll found that 60 percent of Americans would like Trump to make the documents public.) The details of TrumpÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s plan to solve his conflicts of interest remain to be explored and parsed, though he made several peculiar comments during the press conference. He asserted, dubiously, that he has very little debt. He claimed to have been offered a $2 billion deal in Dubai over the weekend, but he said heÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_d turned it down Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  even though, he said, he had no obligation to do so. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI could actually run my business and run the government at the same time,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Trump said. He added, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI have a   situation because IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_m president. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ ThatÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s an outrageous statement. While not all    laws apply to the president, the lack of legal constraints does not mean conflicts of interest cannot exist. Moreover, Trump is still subject to the ConstitutionÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s Emoluments Clause, among other rules. Before taking questions, Trump boasted about companies opening new factories in the U. S. or canceling planned offshoring. Although he claimed credit, most of those decisions were made prior to his election. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created, and I mean that,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he said. And Trump promised to continue to throw his weight around. He thanked states that had voted for him on Election Day and seemed to suggest that those states would be rewarded. He attacked pharmaceutical companies for charging high prices, and said the federal government should bargain with them. Current federal law bars such negotiation for Medicare. While Democrats have long lobbied for greater bargaining power, pushing this argument could put the   into conflict with Republicans in Congress, who have opposed bargaining. Yet as much as the event was a chance for the press to address Trump, it was also a forum for Trump to address Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  and dress down Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  the press. The first speaker was incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who called the publication of the dossier Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍfrankly shameful and disgraceful. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Next up was Mike Pence, who scolded reporters that Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍwith freedom comes responsibility. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ When Trump himself arrived at the lectern, he, too, attacked reporters. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍItÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on a nearly daily basis,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Trump said. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍWe stopped having them because we were getting a lot inaccurate news. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ He also thanked news organizations that had not published the dossier. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI have great respect for the news, and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Trump insisted.","Updated at 12:25 p. m. After months of equivocating on the origin of cyberattacks that targeted Democrats before the election,   Donald Trump said Wednesday that he thinks Russia was behind the intrusions. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍAs for hacking, I think it was Russian,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Trump said at a press conference in New York. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍBut I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Later, he emphasized his skepticism. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍIt couldÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ve been others also,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he said. At a meeting on Friday, the   was briefed on classified intelligence by the heads of the NSA, FBI, and CIA, as well as the Director of National Intelligence. They presented a report that concluded, with high confidence, that the Russian government directed the cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats like Hillary ClintonÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s campaign manager, John Podesta. The investigation also found that that the Russian campaign, ordered by President Vladimir Putin, was engineered to help get Trump elected. A brief, unclassified summary of the agenciesÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ findings was made public last week. Trump said he expects hacking will subside once he takes office. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍRussia will have much greater respect for our country when IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_m leading it than when other people are leading it. You will see that,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ he said. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ[Putin] shouldnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t have done it. I donÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t believe heÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ll do it anymore. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ After touching on RussiaÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s cyberattacks, the   brought up the data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management in 2014 and 2015, which were linked to the Chinese government. He says the   hacking has been blown out of proportion, and that other governments are also involved in  . (One key difference: Information stolen in the OPM data breach has not been made public, while Russian agents leaked sensitive communications between Democrats to WikiLeaks and other mouthpieces for publication.) Trump blamed the Democratic National Committee for its lax cybersecurity, and praised its Republican counterpart for its network protection. He claimed that hackers were Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍunable to break throughÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ the Republican National CommitteeÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s defenses Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_  but the FBI says Russian hackers were in fact able to penetrate some Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍoldÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ computer systems that were Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍno longer in use. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Asked if the RussiaÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s hacking campaign was justified, Trump deflected the question. He said that he has Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍno dealingsÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ with Russia which would leave him vulnerable to being influenced, but declined again to release his tax records to back up his claim.",0.02397431753624454,0.02397431753624454,0.7518284145438277,0.20022295038368318,0.9920198403968079,0.0,0,0,897.6

Cameron Sterling, the    son of Alton Sterling, whose death at the hands of police was caught on video, spoke about his father and protests.  Alton Sterling was killed by Baton Rouge police on 5 July at a convenience store, where he was said to be selling CDs. Baton Rouge police said in a statement that police were called to the convenience store because Sterling had allegedly threatened another patron with a gun.  The press conference on Wednesday is CameronÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s first since he broke into sobs at a nationally broadcast press conference with his mother, following his fatherÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s death. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI came to talk to everyone about one: the death of my father. And, two: about how I feel about people in general,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ said Cameron, whose distinctly young voice was calm and composed in front of the scrum of reporters at the Triple S convenience store. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍPeople, in general, no matter what the race, should come together as one united family. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍNo more arguments, violence, crimes,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ said Cameron.

Everyone needs to protest in the right way, with peace. No violence, none whatsoever. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Earlier on Wednesday, in an interview with CBS News, Cameron said he didnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t believe all police were Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍbadÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ and that all police Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍshouldnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t be punished for other policeÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s crimesÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ.

Alton SterlingÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s death spurred a Department of Justice investigation, protests across the country, and was one of the subjects of a march in Dallas on Thursday when a gunman attacked and killed five police officers there.  His was the first of two police shootings that week, including a shocking video of the shooting of Minnesota man Philandro Castile, the aftermath of which was broadcast live on Facebook by his girlfriend. ","Copies of William ShakespeareÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s first four books, dubbed the Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍHoly Grail of publishingÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ have sold for almost ÍïÍ¢Íâ£2. 5m at auction. ChristieÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s said they were sold as separate lots on Wednesday but were all bought by an anonymous private American collector. The ÍïÍ¢Íâ£2, 479, 000 sale in London included the bardÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s first folio, which is widely considered to be the most important literary publication in the English language. The book, published in 1623, contains 36 plays, 18 of which had not appeared in print before. It fetched ÍïÍ¢Íâ£1. 87m, well above its   estimate of between ÍïÍ¢Íâ£800, 000 and ÍïÍ¢Íâ£1. 2m. ChristieÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s book expert Margaret Ford said it was Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍexhilaratingÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ to bring the newly recorded book to the publicÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s attention on the 400th anniversary of the playwrightÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s death. It was sold along with later editions published in 1632, 1664 and 1685. Ford said: Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍWe are pleased with the results achieved in the sale especially since all four books were acquired by the same private American collector. The universality and timelessness of ShakespeareÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s insight into human nature continues to engage and enthral audiences the world over.

Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ","Debt: $20, 000, Source: College, credit cards, Estimated time till debt free: Unclear, From a purely financial standpoint, my grandmotherÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s death is probably the best thing that has happened to me in my adult life.  My grandmother came from overseas to live with my mother and me when I was in high school, as the ravages of AlzheimerÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s left her unable to care for herself. This was a difficult situation for everyone and money became tight. But I did enjoy getting to spend time with my grandmother, who I seldom got to visit while growing up. Some of the fondest memories I have of her are from this time. We would sit together on the sofa and watch her favorite television show  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   Jeopardy!  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   even if she wasnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t exactly sure who I was.  I did well in high school and chose to attend a prestigious (and expensive) private university, far away from home. I had won some scholarship money for my academic merits. Although the amount of debt I would have after graduating was apparent up front, I did not fully understand it. That large figure seemed so abstract at the time, and I refused to let it dampen my excitement about going to college. I set out to earn more than one degree, which cost me more money. Significant surcharges were added to my tuition for taking excessive credit hours, and even larger fees were incurred when enrolling in summer classes I had to take in order to keep up. Thus the waters of debt started to flood higher than they were supposed to.  I delivered pizzas, worked at the library, tutored and worked an array of other   jobs. This did nothing to abate these rising floodwaters, although the extra money did help me manage the several credit card accounts I was forced to open during this time to pay for food, gas, rent and utilities. I graduated in 4. 5 years with two bachelor of science degrees and two minors, along with nearly a quarter of a million dollars in cumulative debt, mostly from student loans. I wouldnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t change any part of my journey. I met some amazing, lifelong friends in college. I received a   education from truly inspirational professors. And I had the opportunity to work in a laboratory and contribute to meaningful scientific research studying AlzheimerÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s disease.  I strongly desired to go to graduate school. I wanted to pursue scientific research in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, this was unfeasible in light of my debt. Graduate students do not typically earn attractive incomes.  It was around this time that my grandmother passed due to complications following her long struggle with AlzheimerÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s disease. To be sure it was a sad event, as it always is when a loved one dies. But my grandmother had become chronically bedridden, a frail shell of a human being, unable even to recognize her own daughter  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   my mother  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   toward the end.  The coming of death was, I think, a merciful one: it seems that we should pity the living, not the dead. After it happened, my mother looked as though a weight had fallen off her shoulders. She wasnÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t the only one whose burden would be lessened by the loss. After her death, my grandmotherÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s finances, assets and properties were entrusted to my mother. She liquidated nearly all of it, deciding that the best way of putting it to use was by helping me repay my student loan debt.  This was a massive relief from a suffocating situation. My remaining $20, 000 in credit card debt is manageable, although I do not know when I will be completely free of it. I shudder to think of how my situation would be were it not for my grandmotherÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍcontributionÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ. I now work three jobs  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   one   and two    Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_   in order to manage the remaining debt, along with the expense of living in a major metropolitan area. Despite my two degrees and prior work in scientific research, I earn just above minimum wage working   in a laboratory at a     dollar biomedical research institution.  The pay could be better, but I consider myself very fortunate to still be able to work doing scientific research related to neurodegenerative diseases, a field I remain passionate about for obvious reasons. Which is all a bit ironic considering that AlzheimerÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s disease is, indirectly, the only reason IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_m not utterly drowning right now.","It was late. I was drunk, nearing my 35th birthday this past May, alone in a dank college dorm room, attending my   grad school reunion. The journal entry I wrote that night was just one line: Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍIÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_m not the man I want to be. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ As reunion charades go, nothing about my life actually suggested I was off track. I had ambitious public service aspirations worked tenaciously loved fiercely wrote confidently about equal opportunity and the American dream bought into and unabashedly endorsed my adopted hometown of Detroit as the best place in the country to work with meaning and purpose. IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_d published a book. IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_d supported my wife through cancer, relapse, and now four years of remission. I even ran a marathon. But my journal admission reflected two longstanding personal challenges. First, despite all my accomplishments, I carried a deeply held internal anxiety about being Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍgood enoughÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ to meet my ambitions. Second, I believed my alcohol abuse posed a serious threat to it all. Combined, they exposed my biggest fear: was my life of meaning and purpose as I envisioned it slipping through my fingers? I decided to make a change. After nearly 20 years of various cycles of alcohol abuse, moderation and abstinence, I concluded I would take one last shot at forging a balanced approach to drinking before turning to sobriety. IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_d read about a drug called naltrexone, which is a pill that helps mitigate and manage alcohol cravings and abuse. After sporadically trying it over the prior year, I decided to use it every day for the next three months. Change came quickly. Two months in, my weekly consumption had cut in half it would cut in half again by early October. I lost 20 pounds and felt great. In tears, I confided to my wife, Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍIÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ve finally broken through. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍIÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_m so proud of you,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ my wife replied. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍIÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_m so grateful you found a path that works. LetÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s stick with it. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ That was Monday, 10 October. Two days later, I was diagnosed with stage IV kidney cancer. Less than 15% of people with my diagnosis survive five years. This prompted a swift resolution of my other core challenge: I would no longer allow my anxiety about Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍliving the right wayÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ interfere with being my true self in all dimensions of this life. There would no longer be any distinction between the Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍrepresentative versionÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ of me online versus living every day with full authenticity. Any other way would be a total waste of time.  IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ve embraced the news as an invitation to be my most honest, vulnerable and wholehearted self. I live every day as fully integrated and courageously as possible. I donÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t waver. One key outlet has been a podcast I started with my wife and best friend called Defending Your Life, where we process in real time the unfiltered experience, fears and reality of dealing with stage IV cancer. I write now more directly, less esoterically, about my experience on my blog. Although my opportunities to achieve my public service or other professional goals down the road may now be limited by time or strength, I now know they wonÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t be hobbled by inauthenticity. Most importantly, IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ve come to recognize that I have lived a life of meaning and purpose. A life rich with love and connection. Some have even generously shared that IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ve lived a life that has inspired others. And, having worked through my demons, IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_m able to forgive and be proud of myself too. Of course, whatÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s scary now is while there is so much to live for, this disease, despite all the science, love and everything else needed to take it on, could very well ultimately beat me. I had surgery in October and am facing upcoming systemic treatments over the next   months, and it remains to be seen whether that will make me one of the  % who achieve a Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍcomplete responseÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ or the 94% who end up somewhere else along the kidney cancer progression line. The truth is, weÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_re all terminal. I could also get hit by a bus tomorrow. Or I could beat the odds and live till IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_m 90. But whatever my time left on this earth, IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_ll now endeavor forward with some earned resolve. I am the person I want to be. IÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_m not afraid.","A central Texas man serving a life sentence for a double murder in 1992 is innocent, as are three codefendants no longer in prison, a state judge has found. Retired district judge George Allen ruled Friday that Richard Bryan Kussmaul, 45, should be free. His three codefendants each received   sentences and have already been released.  DNA evidence not available two decades ago shows the four werenÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_t involved in the fatal shootings of    Leslie Murphy and    Stephen Neighbors at a home near Moody, south of Waco, Allen said in a   opinion.  AllenÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s recommendation now goes to the Texas court of criminal appeals for a final decision. The stateÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s top criminal appeals court had ordered a hearing held last month to look into the menÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s claims they were innocent.  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍThe evidence just seemed overwhelming, with the DNA evidence having excluded these men from any contact whatsoever with these people,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ KussmaulÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s lawyer, David Sheppard, told the Waco  . Allen presided over the trial where Kussmaul was convicted of murder. His three   James Edward Long, Michael Dewayne Shelton and James Wayne Pitts Jr, were convicted of sexual assault. Long and Pitts served 20 years. Shelton was released after 17 years.  At the hearing last month, Long, Shelton and Pitts all testified they gave false testimony against Kussmaul at his trial because a prosecutor promised them probation. They also said their confessions were coerced by a deputy who threatened them with the death penalty. The three said at KussmaulÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s trial in 1994 that he and they raped Murphy before Kussmaul shot the two victims. After they were sentenced to 20 years in prison, each recanted his confession. Kussmaul did not testify at the hearing.  Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI was willing to say anything they wanted me to say because I thought I was getting probation and no prison time,Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ Long said at the July hearing. Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍI had two small children and I was afraid of going to prison for life or, worse, getting executed. Íï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ  If the court upholds the judgeÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s opinion and the menÍï¢ÍâÍ_Íâ_s claims of actual innocence, they each could be eligible for a state payout of $80, 000 for each year in prison.

7206,489,2,c,transcript,2467,2464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"Good morning. How are you?(Laughter)It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I'm leaving.(Laughter)There have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here. Just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen, in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out.I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is everybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ Actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly.(Laughter)If you work in education, you're not asked.(Laughter)And you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, ""What do you do?"" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They're like, ""Oh my God,"" you know, ""Why me?""(Laughter)""My one night out all week.""(Laughter)But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall. Because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion, and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents. And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.(Applause) Thank you.(Applause)That was it, by the way. Thank you very much.(Laughter)So, 15 minutes left.(Laughter)Well, I was born... no.(Laughter)I heard a great story recently Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ I love telling it Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her, and she said, ""What are you drawing?"" And the girl said, ""I'm drawing a picture of God."" And the teacher said, ""But nobody knows what God looks like."" And the girl said, ""They will, in a minute.""(Laughter)When my son was four in England Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ Actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.(Laughter)If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story?(Laughter)No, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.(Laughter)""Nativity II."" But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: ""James Robinson IS Joseph!"" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said, ""You OK with that?"" And he said, ""Yeah, why? Was that wrong?"" They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads, and they put these boxes down, and the first boy said, ""I bring you gold."" And the second boy said, ""I bring you myrrh."" And the third boy said, ""Frank sent this.""(Laughter)What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities.Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. So why is this?I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was.(Laughter)Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he?(Laughter)How annoying would that be?(Laughter)""Must try harder.""(Laughter)Being sent to bed by his dad, you know, to Shakespeare, ""Go to bed, now! And put the pencil down.""(Laughter)""And stop speaking like that.""(Laughter)""It's confusing everybody.""(Laughter)Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition. My son didn't want to come. I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16. He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month.(Laughter)Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. He was really upset on the plane, he said, ""I'll never find another girl like Sarah."" And we were rather pleased about that, frankly Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_(Laughter)Because she was the main reason we were leaving the country.(Laughter)But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities, and at the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on Earth. And in pretty much every system too, there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important, but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting?(Laughter)Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side.If you were to visit education, as an alien, and say ""What's it for, public education?"" I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything that they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there.(Laughter)And I like university professors, but you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life, another form of life. But they're rather curious, and I say this out of affection for them. There's something curious about professors in my experience Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ not all of them, but typically, they live in their heads. They live up there, and slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads.(Laughter)Don't they? It's a way of getting their head to meetings.(Laughter)If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics, and pop into the discotheque on the final night.(Laughter)And there, you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.(Laughter)Waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it.(Laughter)Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist. Benign advice Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution.And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities designed the system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly-talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way.In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people, and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ technology and its transformation effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population.Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence.We know three things about intelligence. One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms, we think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact, creativity Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things.By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking. Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ which is not often, thankfully.(Laughter)No, she's good at some things, but if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling, she's doing open-heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in I get annoyed. I say, ""Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here.""(Laughter)""Give me a break.""(Laughter)Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, did it happen? Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great t-shirt recently, which said, ""If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?""(Laughter)And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called ""Epiphany,"" which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work. She did ""Cats"" and ""Phantom of the Opera."" She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see. Anyway, Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said, ""How did you get to be a dancer?"" It was interesting. When she was at school, she was really hopeless. And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, ""We think Gillian has a learning disorder."" She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition.(Laughter)People weren't aware they could have that.(Laughter)Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems Gillian was having at school. Because she was disturbing people; her homework was always late; and so on, little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian, and said, ""I've listened to all these things your mother's told me, I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back; we won't be very long,"" and they went and left her.But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out, he said to her mother, ""Just stand and watch her."" And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said, ""Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick; she's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.""I said, ""What happened?"" She said, ""She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room and it was full of people like me. People who couldn't sit still. People who had to move to think."" Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School; she became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multi-millionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down.(Applause)What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth: for a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children.There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, ""If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years all forms of life would flourish."" And he's right.What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future. By the way Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it.Thank you very much.(Applause)","Thank you so much, Chris. And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that.(Laughter)Put yourselves in my position.(Laughter)I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.(Laughter)Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane!(Laughter)(Applause)I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me.(Laughter)It's a true story Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ every bit of this is true.Soon after Tipper and I left the Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ (Mock sob) White House Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_(Laughter)we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves.(Laughter)I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_(Laughter)I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there.(Laughter)You've heard of phantom limb pain?(Laughter)This was a rented Ford Taurus.(Laughter)It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant. Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it. We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper.(Laughter)She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. And she said ""Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper."" And the man said, ""He's come down a long way, hasn't he?""(Laughter)(Applause)There's been kind of a series of epiphanies.(Laughter)The very next day, continuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy. And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ they laughed. I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway. And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, ""Call Washington! Call Washington!"" And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington? Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things.(Laughter)But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey, I checked.(Laughter)And the story began, ""Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday,"" quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'"" Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_(Laughter)""'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'""(Laughter)Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, ""One more burger with fries!""(Laughter)Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, ""Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!""(Laughter)We like to celebrate each other's successes in life.(Laughter)I was going to talk about information ecology. But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time.(Applause)Chris Anderson: It's a deal!(Applause)Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. Now, the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it. I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. It's like beach-combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells. Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January. This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees.Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ it's not a cost; it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative; it's positive. These are investments that pay for themselves. But they are also very effective in deflecting our path.Cars and trucks Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy, visible target of concern Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ and it should be Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world. And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ there are a lot of people directly involved in this Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ that's what CCS stands for Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do?Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important.Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. Consider this: Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ with my active involvement Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science of carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce. And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through purchases of offsets.Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. Over time, people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. A lot more to be said about that.Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it, talk about it. The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.(Applause)Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics? It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ global warming pollution Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ and trading it. Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation, then everybody who's on a board of directors Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation? Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. We have to change the minds of the American people. Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done.And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested. I like ""climate crisis"" instead of ""climate collapse,"" but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this. Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination.(Laughter)That's really true.I said the other night, and I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ this shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one.Thank you very much, I appreciate it.(Applause)","(Music: ""The Sound of Silence,"" Simon & Garfunkel)Hello voice mail, my old friend.(Laughter)I've called for tech support again. I ignored my boss's warning. I called on a Monday morning. Now it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold, and then grew mold. I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence. I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned. I punched every touch tone I was told, but I've still spent 18 hours on hold. It's not enough your software crashed my Mac, and it constantly hangs and bombs Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ it erased my ROMs! Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence. In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys. Say your motorcycle crashes. Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me.(Laughter)And you listen to the sounds of silence.(Music)(Applause)Thank you.Good evening and welcome to: ""Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist.""(Laughter)When I was offered the Times column six years ago, the deal was like this: you'll be sent the coolest, hottest, slickest new gadgets. Every week, it'll arrive at your door. You get to try them out, play with them, evaluate them until the novelty wears out, before you have to send them back, and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it, if you want. So, I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it. The job, though, came with one small downside, and that is, they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column. And what I've noticed is Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ first of all, you get an incredible amount of email.If you ever are feeling lonely, get a New York Times column, because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration. People are feeling like things Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ Ok, I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like it's too much technology, too fast. It may be good technology, but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure. There's not enough help. There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support, and within 12 hours, there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website, from users saying, """"Me too, and here's my tale of woe."" I call it ""software rage."" And man, let me tell you, whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ Oh, how did that get up there? Just kidding.(Laughter)Ok, so why is the problem accelerating? And part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use. I'll show you what I mean. This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS. Over the years, it's gotten easier to use. This is the original Mac operating system. Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette. And the entire operating system Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ this is the good part Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ the entire operating system fit in 211 k. You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in 211 k!(Laughter)So the irony is, that as these things became easier to use, a less technical, broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time.I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day. The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to. And the calls that Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ you know how they say, ""Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?"" Uh-uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD.(Laughter)Which they do.(Laughter)And I have a copy.(Laughter)It's in your gift bag. No, no. With your voices on it!So, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable. A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking. Making a squeaking noise. And the technician said,""Well, ma'am, what do you mean your mouse is squeaking?""She says, ""All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder, the faster I move it across the screen.""(Laughter)And the technician's like, ""Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?""She goes, ""Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'""(Laughter)Well, if you like that one Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ how much time have we got? Another one, a guy called Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ this is absolutely true Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ his computer had crashed, and he told the technician he couldn't restart it, no matter how many times he typed ""11."" And the technician said, ""What? Why are you typing 11?"" He said, ""The message says, 'Error Type 11.'""(Laughter)So, we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users. But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now?In the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller. So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier, but our fingers are essentially staying the same size. So it gets to be more and more of a challenge. Software is subject to another primal force: the mandate to release more and more versions. When you buy a piece of software, it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it. It's more like joining a club, where you pay dues every year, and every year, they say, ""We've added more features, and we'll sell it to you for $99."" I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years. And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times, you eventually ruin it.I mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know, the Eisenhower administration.(Laughter)But what's the alternative? Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said, ""Well, wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features. Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor: Simple, pure; does not do web pages, is not a database."" And it came out, and it was called Microsoft Write. And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment, because it died. It tanked. No one ever bought it. I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power, right? They don't need the database and the website, but they're like, ""Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday."" So the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go? Where are you going to stick them? You only have so many design tools. You can do buttons, you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus. But if you're not careful about how you choose, you wind up with this.(Laughter)This is an un-retouched Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ this is not a joke Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word, the copy that you have, with all the toolbars open. You've obviously never opened all the toolbars, but all you have to type in is this little, teeny window down here.(Laughter)And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices, where there are so many features and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. The off switch is in there somewhere. I'm telling you Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ it's there. Part of the art of designing a simple, good interface, is knowing when to use which one of these features. So, here is the log-off dialogue box for Windows 2000. There are only four choices, so why are they in a pop-up menu? It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices. They could have put them all out in view.Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box.(Applause)Thank you Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ yes, I designed the dialogue box. No, no. Already, we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design. Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be: let's break it down; let's just make it more steps. There are these ""wizards"" everywhere. And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall. If they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up.[Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard](Laughter)(Applause)""Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard."" Ok, I'll bite. Let's click ""Next"" to continue.(Laughter)(Applause)From the drop-down menu, choose the first letter you want to type. Ok.(Laughter)So there is a limit that we don't want to cross. So what is the answer? How do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way? I believe in consistency, when possible, real-world equivalents, trash can folder, when possible, label things, mostly. But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that? I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.If you are buying something on the web, you're supposed to put in your address, and you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok? There are 200 countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village. I'm sorry; it's not one yet. It's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan. So why is ""United States"" in the ""U""s?(Laughter)You have to scroll, like, seven screensful to get to it. Now, it would be inconsistent to put ""United States"" first, but it would be intelligent.This one's been touched on before, but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called ""Start?""(Laughter)Here's another pet one of mine: you have a printer. Most of the time, you want to print one copy of your document, in page order, on that printer. So why in God's name do you see this every time you print? It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.(Laughter)And one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not ""Print.""(Laughter)(Applause)Now, I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity. Palm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this. I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '90s, and after the talk, I met one of the employees. He says, ""Nice talk."" And I said, ""Thank you. What do you do here?"" He said, ""I'm a tap counter."" I'm like, ""You're a what?"" He goes, ""Well Jeff Hawkins, the CEO, says, 'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus, it's too long, and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter."" So, I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter.(Laughter)This is Microsoft Word. Ok, when you want to create a new blank document in Word Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ it could happen.(Laughter)You go up to the ""File"" menu and you choose ""New."" Now, what happens when you choose ""New?"" Do you get a new blank document? You do not. On the opposite side of the monitor, a task bar appears, and somewhere in those links Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ by the way, not at the top Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document. Ok, so that is a company not counting taps. You know, I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ... Yes, I do.(Laughter)(Applause)The Bill Gates song!(Piano music)I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS. I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss.(Laughter)I write the code that makes the whole world run. I'm getting royalties from everyone. Sometimes it's garbage, but the press is snowed. You buy the box; I'll sell the code. Every software company is doing Microsoft's R&D. You can't keep a good idea down these days. Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. So it's big, so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise. I write the code that fits the world today. Big mediocrity in every way. We've entered planet domination mode. You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code. I am Bill Gates and I write the code.(Applause)But actually, I believe there are really two Microsofts. There's the old one, responsible for Windows and Office. They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't. They're locked in, because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis. But there's also a new Microsoft, that's really doing good, simple interface designs. I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market, but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed. But let's put it this way: would you pay $10 a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone, and stops working when you leave your area code?(Laughter)So, the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse. So is there any hope? The screens are getting smaller, people are illuminating, putting manuals in the boxes, things are coming out at a faster pace. It's funny Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997, after 12 years away, it was the MacWorld Expo Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans, and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild, but I had just seen Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ I'm like, where have I seen this before? I had just seen the movie ""Evita"" Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_(Laughter)with Madonna, and I'm like, you know what? I've got to do one about Steve Jobs.(Music)It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange.(Laughter)When I try to explain why I'm back, after telling the press Apple's future is black. You won't believe me. All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz.(Laughter)You try rhyming with garage!(Laughter)Don't cry for me, Cupertino.(Laughter)The truth is, I never left you. I know the ropes now, know what the tricks are. I made a fortune over at Pixar.(Laughter)Don't cry for me, Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision. I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days, they're Gucci leather.(Laughter)(Applause)Thank you.So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is, for years I was a little depressed, because Americans obviously did not value it, because the Mac had three percent market share, Windows had 95 percent market share Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ people did not think it was worth putting a price on it. So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk, and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed.(Laughter)But it turns out I was wrong, right? Because the iPod came out, and it violated every bit of common wisdom. Other products cost less; other products had more features, they had voice recorders and FM transmitters. The other products were backed by Microsoft, with an open standard, not Apple's propriety standard. But the iPod won Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ this is the one they wanted. The lesson was: simplicity sells. And there are signs that the industry is getting the message. This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance. The Sonos thing Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ it's catching on.I've got just a couple examples. Physically, a really cool, elegant thinking coming along lately. When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures back to your computer? Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader and haul that around. Either one, you're going to lose. What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures, put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything. Here's another example. Chris, you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug?Chris Anderson: Oh yeah. DP: Hold that and don't let go. You might've seen this, this is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord. It hooks on like this. And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives, or one of your children. You walk along Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ and I'm about to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner. Here we go. Whoa! It's magnetic Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor.(Applause)In my very last example Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software. And I'll just Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly; period. Like, I get hundreds of them a day; period. And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period. I also use this feature called voice macros; period. Correct ""dissuade."" Not ""just."" Ok, this is not an ideal situation, because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff. The point is, I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word, and having it write out a much longer thing. So if somebody sends me a fan letter, I'll say, ""Thanks for that.""[Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...](Laughter)(Applause)And conversely, if somebody sends me hate mail Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ which happens daily Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ I say, ""Piss off.""(Laughter)[I admire your frankness ...](Laughter)(Applause)So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone.(Laughter)So the point is Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ this is a really interesting story. This is version eight of this software, and do you know what they put in version eight? No new features. It's never happened before in software! The company put no new features. They just said, ""We'll make this software work right."" Right? Because for years, people had bought this software, tried it out Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ 95 percent accuracy was all they got, which means one in 20 words is wrong Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that, so they said, ""This version, we're not going to do anything, but make sure it's darned accurate."" And so that's what they did.This cult of doing things right is starting to spread. So, my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology: remember, if it doesn't work, it's not necessarily you, ok? It could be the design of the thing you're using. Be aware in life of good design and bad design. And if you're among the people who create this stuff: Easy is hard. Pre-sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps. Remember, the hard part is not deciding what features to add, it's deciding what to leave out. And best of all, your motivation is: simplicity sells.CA: Bravo. DP: Thank you very much.CA: Hear, hear!(Applause)","If you're here today Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ and I'm very happy that you are Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City. And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger.The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998. She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest food-distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week. The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city.So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier. Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump. There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me, and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river. I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving. And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined. We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years. We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times, into a $3 million park.And in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved.(Audience whistles)Thank you very much.(Applause)That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.(Laughter)(Applause)But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. We feel the problems right now, and have for some time. Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other.Unfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities. As a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health. I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility, which I do. These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma. Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood? Our 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country, and diabetes comes with it. One out of four South Bronx children has asthma. Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average. These impacts are coming everyone's way. And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs, health problems associated with pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men, who possess untold amounts of untapped potential. Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line; 25 percent of us are unemployed. Low-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care. This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits. Poor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy.Fortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short term, and won't destroy us all in the long term. None of us want that, and we all have that in common. So what else do we have in common?Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking.(Laughter)Graduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned. OK. Good.(Laughter)But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways. I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down. My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home. Jesus. I grew up with a crack house across the street. Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto. These things make me different from you. But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community, and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other.So how did things get so different for us? In the late '40s, my dad Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ a Pullman porter, son of a slave Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, and a few years later, he married my mom. At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood. My dad was not alone. And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream, white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country. Red-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment. Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding.Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boom was added to our problems. In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign. One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan. The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance. Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed. 600,000 people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx. And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community, that it's bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you? So now, my family's property was worthless, save for that it was our home, and all we had. And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough.Now, why is this story important? Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come. Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided? What costs are associated with these decisions? And who pays? Who profits? Does anything justify what the local community goes through? This was ""planning"" Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ in quotes Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ that did not have our best interests in mind.Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning. That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx. I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths. Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste and other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life. They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development. Think bike shops, juice stands. We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects. This is Lafayette Avenue Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park. Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that.As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more. We run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs. Little by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment. The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it. Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused. The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway. We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices. Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to the building or atmosphere. Green roofs are soil and living plants. Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban ""heat island"" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine. And they provide habitats for our little friends![Butterfly](Laughter)So cool!Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.[Green is the new black ...](Laughter) (Applause)I like that, too.Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: We need investors. End of pitch. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Anyway Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_(Laughter)(Applause)OK. Katrina.Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz. Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common. We're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability. Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable. But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out. We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone. Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two, like the South Bronx did? Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine?Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral. This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue. But I'll tell you later, if you want to know.(Laughter)But Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end. I'm interested in what I like to call the ""triple bottom line"" that sustainable development can produce. Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up.At present, that's not happening in New York City. And we are operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit. A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space. And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny. Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks. Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier. And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit. Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes. My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues.Now let's get this straight: I am not anti-development. Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist. And, but I don't have Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_(Laughter)You probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to.(Laughter)So I don't have a problem with developers making money. There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune. Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ both heroes of mine by the way Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ have shown that you can actually do that. I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit. That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible for the future that we create. But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities, is to learn from visionaries in other cities. This is my version of globalization.Let's take Bogota. Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking; a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx. However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly-influential mayor named Enrique PeÍïÍ Íâ±alosa. He looked at the demographics. Few Bogotanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them. If you're a mayor, you can do something about that. His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world. For his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached. But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened. People stopped littering. Crime rates dropped, because the streets were alive with people. His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget, at that. We have no excuse in this country, I'm sorry. But the bottom line is: their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather, to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence. That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S. But Bogota's example has the power to change that.You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence. That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange. Use your influence in support of comprehensive, sustainable change everywhere. Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal. Help me make green the new black. Help me make sustainability sexy. Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations. Help me fight for environmental and economic justice. Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return. Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table, and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere. Oh good, glad I have a little more time!Listen Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy. His response was a grant program. I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding. I was making him an offer.(Applause)What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around. Now, don't get me wrong, we need money.(Laughter)But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process. Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count.(Applause)I have come from so far to meet you like this. Please don't waste me. By working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world. We might have come to this conference from very, very different stations in life, but believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain.Ciao, bellos!(Applause)","About 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. That was after having spent about 20 years together with African institutions studying hunger in Africa, so I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. And I started in our medical university, Karolinska Institute, an undergraduate course called Global Health. But when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous. I thought, these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in Swedish college systems Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ so I thought, maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about. So I did a pre-test when they came. And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one: ""Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?""I put them together, so that in each pair of country, one has twice the child mortality of the other. And this means that it's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data. I won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey, which is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan and South Africa. And these were the results of the Swedish students. I did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow, and I got happy, of course: a 1.8 right answer out of five possible. That means that there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course.(Laughter)But one late night, when I was compiling the report, I really realized my discovery. I have shown that Swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees.(Laughter)Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there. The problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas.I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute, that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par with the chimpanzee there.(Laughter)This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate, because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware.We did this software which displays it like this: every bubble here is a country. This country over here is China. This is India. The size of the bubble is the population, and on this axis here, I put fertility rate. Because my students, what they said when they looked upon the world, and I asked them, ""What do you really think about the world?"" Well, I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.(Laughter)And they said, ""The world is still 'we' and 'them.' And 'we' is Western world and 'them' is Third World."" ""And what do you mean with Western world?"" I said. ""Well, that's long life and small family, and Third World is short life and large family.""So this is what I could display here. I put fertility rate here: number of children per woman: one, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman. We have very good data since 1962 Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ 1960 about Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ on the size of families in all countries. The error margin is narrow. Here, I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries up to about 70 years. And 1962, there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries, and they had small families and long lives. And these were the developing countries: they had large families and they had relatively short lives. Now, what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change. Are the students right? Is it still two types of countries? Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here? Or have they got longer lives and live up there?Let's see. We stopped the world then. This is all U.N. statistics that have been available. Here we go. Can you see there? It's China there, moving against better health there, improving there. All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families. Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries, and they get longer life, but not larger families. The Africans are the green here. They still remain here. This is India; Indonesia is moving on pretty fast.(Laughter)In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries. But now, Bangladesh Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ it's a miracle that happens in the '80s: the imams start to promote family planning. They move up into that corner. And in the '90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries and all the rest of them move up into the corner, where we have long lives and small family, and we have a completely new world.(Applause)(Applause ends)Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam. 1964. America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families and short lives. And this is what happens: the data during the war indicate that even with all the death, there was an improvement of life expectancy. By the end of the year, the family planning started in Vietnam; they went for smaller families. And the United States up there is getting for longer life, keeping family size. And in the '80s now, they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy, and it moves faster even than social life. And today, we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam, 2003, as in United States, 1974, by the end of the war. If we don't look in the data, I think we all underestimate the tremendous change in Asia, which was in social change before we saw the economical change.Let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of the income. This is the world distribution of income of people. One dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day. There's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth. There's a little hump here. But there are people all the way. And if we look where the income ends up, this is 100 percent the world's annual income. And the richest 20 percent, they take out of that about 74 percent. And the poorest 20 percent, they take about two percent. And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful. We think about aid, like these people here giving aid to these people here. But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income.We heard it in other forms. And who are these? Where are the different countries? I can show you Africa. This is Africa. 10% the world population, most in poverty. This is OECD. The rich country. The country club of the U.N. And they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD. And this is Latin America. It has everything on this Earth, from the poorest to the richest in Latin America. And on top of that, we can put East Europe, we can put East Asia, and we put South Asia.And how did it look like if we go back in time, to about 1970? Then there was more of a hump. And we have most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians. The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia. And if I now let the world move forward, you will see that while population increases, there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty, and this is the pattern we have today. And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen, and we will not have a divided world. We'll have most people in the middle.Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy is growth with percent. We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase. If I change this, and take GDP per capita instead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product, and I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble is still the population. And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival. Now I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility of children to survive there. In some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age; others, only 70. And here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The linearity is very strong between child survival and money.But let me split sub-Saharan Africa. Health is there and better health is up there. I can go here and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries. And when it burst, the size of its country bubble is the size of the population. Sierra Leone down there. Mauritius is up there. Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ they could sell their textiles Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America.There's a huge difference between Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle. In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid. Here in Uganda, development aid. Here, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday. It's a tremendous variation within Africa which we rarely often make Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ that it's equal everything. I can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle. But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. I can split Arab states. How are they? Same climate, same culture, same religion Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ huge difference. Even between neighbors. Yemen, civil war. United Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well used. Not as the myth is. And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country.Data is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad. There is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here: Cambodia, Singapore. The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data. East Europe: Soviet economy for a long time, but they come out after 10 years very, very differently. And there is Latin America. Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America. Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now. Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD.And we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like this. And if we look at it, how the world looks, in 1960, it starts to move. This is Mao Tse-tung. He brought health to China. And then he died. And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China, and brought them into the mainstream again. And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this, so it's sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world.But I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960. I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one. The label went away for me here. And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there. And I can run it forward, like this. And you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower.And if we move back again, here, and we put on trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development is very, very different, and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first. And to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates. They came from here, a mineral country. They cached all the oil; they got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket. You have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling. You have to train health staff. You have to educate the population. And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way. In spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here. So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world, where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the past.Now, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries Íï¢ÍâÍ_ÍâÍ_ they are like this. Now that's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such a lot of difference within countries. So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960. If I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda. These are the quintiles of Uganda. The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there. The poorest are down there. If I split South Africa, it's like this. And if I go down and look at Niger, where there was such a terrible famine, lastly, it's like this. The 20 percent poorest of Niger is out here, and the 20 percent richest of South Africa is there, and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in Africa. Everything in this world exists in Africa. And you can't discuss universal access to HIV [medicine] for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here. The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it on regional level. We must be much more detailed. We find that students get very excited when they can use this.And even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing. Now, why doesn't this take place? Why are we not using the data we have? We have data in the United Nations, in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other non-governmental organizations. Because the data is hidden down in the databases. And the public is there, and the Internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively.All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly-funded statistics. There are some web pages like this, you know, but they take some nourishment down from the databases, but people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics.(Laughter)And this won't work.(Applause)So what is needed? We have the databases. It's not the new database you need. We have wonderful design tools, and more and more are added up here. So we started a nonprofit venture which, linking data to design, we called Gapminder, from the London Underground, where they warn you, ""mind the gap."" So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. And we started to write software which could link the data like this. And it wasn't that difficult. It took some person years, and we have produced animations. You can take a data set and put it there. We are liberating U.N. data, some few U.N. organization.Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world, but what we really need is, of course, a search function. A search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world. And what do we hear when we go around? I've done anthropology on the main statistical units. Everyone says, ""It's impossible. This can't be done. Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. We cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world.""But this is what we would like to see, isn't it? The publicly-funded data is down here. And we would like flowers to grow out on the Net. And one of the crucial points is to make them searchable, and then people can use the different design tool to animate it there. And I have pretty good news for you. I have good news that the present, new Head of U.N. Statistics, he doesn't say it's impossible. He only says, ""We can't do it.""(Laughter)And that's a quite clever guy, huh?(Laughter)So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years. We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways. This is the income distribution of China, 1970. This is the income distribution of the United States, 1970. Almost no overlap. And what has happened? What has happened is this: that China is growing, it's not so equal any longer, and it's appearing here, overlooking the United States. Almost like a ghost, isn't it?(Laughter)It's pretty scary.(Laughter)But I think it's very important to have all this information. We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing the Internet users per 1,000. In this software, we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easily. It takes some time to change for this, but on the axises, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have. And the thing would be to get up the databases free, to get them searchable, and with a second click, to get them into the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them. Now, statisticians don't like it, because they say that this will not show the reality; we have to have statistical, analytical methods. But this is hypothesis-generating.I end now with the world. There, the Internet is coming. The number of Internet users are going up like this. This is the GDP per capita. And it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countries. That's why the $100 computer will be so important. But it's a nice tendency. It's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it? These countries are lifting more than the economy and will be very interesting to follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data.Thank you very much.(Applause)",0.04880421457750284,0.04880421457750284,0.4948002465416847,0.40759132430330974,0.9987839481151196,0.0,0,0,2909.0

This is full, layered, intense and cushioned on the palate, with rich flavors of chocolaty black fruits and baking spices. A toasty, everlasting finish is heady but ideally balanced. Drink through 2023.","Mac Watson honors the memory of a wine once made by his mother in this tremendously delicious, balanced and complex botrytised white.

Aromatic, dense and toasty, it deftly blends aromas and flavors of toast, cigar box, blackberry, black cherry, coffee and graphite. Tannins are polished to a fine sheen, and frame a finish loaded with dark chocolate and espresso. Drink now through 2032.","This is the top wine from La BÍïÍ Íâ©gude, named after the highest point in the vineyard at 1200 feet.

We always head here after nursing the usual high cost city hangover - but don't worry at Ballans you will never feel ripped off ! 3 types of eggs to choose from all cooked to perfection with a lovely sausage , toast , beans and small pieces of hash browns take a beer on the side and enjoy your trip to balans don't even look another way in the Westfield this is THE place to go !!!! Come on","Average pub, where you can be serve quickly. Th only down side will be the crowd around the some of the staff. You do't fell very welcome there","Personally my favourite Pakistani restaurant in tooting. Good food, good meat quality and a reasonable price.","For a while now IÌ¢åÛåªve been dreaming of that Burger to die for, few places do the Burger that makes you think, should I or shouldnÌ¢åÛåªt I, as it looks so bad but tastes so damn good. Well GBK has this tied down to a Tee, they make Burgers that not only tastes great but look amazing. To have your Burger cooked to medium is perfect for me. I had the Avocado Bacon Burger whilst my Beautiful Daughter had the Cheese and Bacon, take your pick as youÌ¢åÛåªll be satisfied with any on the menu. The staff were also very helpful in the Ealing branch. A must try.","It's close to Regent Street and its tucked away in one of the back streets. Nice quaint restaurant that serves good, delectable japanese cuisine. It is definitely one of the better japanese restaurants in the area for sure.",0.07863993997536833,0.07863993997536833,0.7640801800738947,0.07863993997536833,0.888038803880388,0.11006100610061006,0,0,55.2
